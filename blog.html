                        This blog post discusses how to automate the process of updating an RSS feed for a blog or website using shell and Python scripts. The post describes how the RSS feed was set up and the process of creating a shell script that calls a Python script to extract the title and contents of a new blog post and insert it into the RSS feed as a new item element. The post also mentions plans to have the script automatically detect when a new blog post has been added and run the update automatically in the future. The URL for the RSS feed is also provided.

                        In this blog post, I share my experience setting up and using Diffusion Bee, an AI image creating software that runs entirely locally on my MacBook Pro. 
                        I go through the setup process and the different modes of use, including text to image, image to image, in-painting, out-painting, and upscaling. 
                        If you're interested in using stable diffusion and have a MacBook that meets the minimum specs, I highly recommend checking out Diffusion Bee!

                        In this blog post, I  discuss how to automate the process of updating your website using a shell script. 
                        I go over the steps for setting up SSH keys for your server and creating a shell script that can commit and push updates to your website's repository, log in to the server, and pull the updates. 
                        I also provide an example of the shell script in action. 
                        Finally, I introduce the concept of cronjobs and how they can be used to further automate the maintenance and management of your website.

                        Get an update on my PhD research project using machine learning to detect vault apps in the Aptoide 3rd party Android app store. 
                        The project involves scraping and collecting data from app sites, downloading and decompiling apk files, and using regular expressions to search for permissions data and imported packages. 
                        The goal is to create software to help law enforcement locate and determine how information is stored in hidden vault apps. 
                        The project is progressing well and I am excited to see the results of the machine learning program once it is trained on collected data.
