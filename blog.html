                    </a>
                    <p>
                        Welcome back to our DevOps series! In this post, we explore how to use Docker and Artifactory together to create a container registry. To create a Docker repository in Artifactory, we'll need to configure the repository settings, such as the repository key, the base URL, and the Docker API version, and push Docker images to it using the docker push command. We'll also need to create a Docker configuration file that specifies the Artifactory registry as the default registry and tag and push Docker images to Artifactory. To distribute Docker images from Artifactory to other systems, we can use the Artifactory REST API or configure other systems to pull images from the Artifactory registry. With Docker and Artifactory working together, we can easily create a container registry and manage and distribute Docker images as part of our software development process. In the next post in this series, we'll explore how to use Jenkins, Docker, and Artifactory together to create a complete DevOps pipeline.

                        Welcome back to our DevOps series! In this post, we explore how to manage and distribute binary artifacts with Artifactory. After uploading artifacts to Artifactory using curl or a build tool like Maven or Gradle, we can manage them using the Artifactory web UI or the Artifactory REST API. We can also distribute artifacts to other systems using the Artifactory web UI or the Artifactory REST API. To simplify the process of managing and distributing artifacts, we can create a virtual repository in Artifactory that aggregates multiple repositories. With a virtual repository in place, we can distribute artifacts to other systems using a single URL, making it easier to manage and distribute artifacts. In the next post in this series, we'll explore how to use Docker and Artifactory together to create a container registry.

                    <p>
                        In this tutorial series, we've covered several key aspects of developing a Java web application using Spring Boot. In the first post, we explored how to create a web server and implement a simple REST API for managing notes. The second post demonstrated how to use Spring Security to secure the web application, while the third post focused on using Hibernate to store and retrieve data from a MySQL database. Finally, in this fourth and last post, we learned how to use Thymeleaf to create dynamic HTML templates for our web application. By following these steps, you should have a solid foundation for developing a Java web application using Spring Boot. However, there is always more to learn, and we encourage you to explore additional resources and continue building your skills in Java and Maven.

                        The Visitor Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that separates an algorithm from the objects it operates on. This pattern is used when we need to perform operations on a group of unrelated objects. In this blog post, we will explore the Visitor pattern in detail with examples in both Java and C#. We will create a hierarchy of animals in Java and a library of items in C#, and implement Visitor pattern to perform operations on these objects. We will also see how to use the Visitor pattern to perform multiple operations on these objects.

                    <p>
                        The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one as an object, and make them interchangeable. This pattern provides a way to vary the behavior of an object dynamically by changing its strategy object at runtime. This post provides an overview of the Strategy Pattern, including when to use it, the UML diagram, and an example implementation of a Sorter class that can sort an array of integers using different sorting algorithms interchangeably. By using this pattern, we can reduce code duplication, make our code more organized and maintainable, and ensure that each algorithm is responsible for handling its own behavior.

                        Learn how to implement the State Design Pattern in Java with two real-world examples. The State Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables objects to change their behavior based on their internal state. In this post, we explain the three main components of the State Design Pattern: Context, State, and Transition. We then provide two examples of how the State Design Pattern can be implemented in Java. The first example is a vending machine that dispenses products based on its current state, and the second example is a fan with different speed states. These examples demonstrate how the State Design Pattern can make code more modular and easier to maintain, while simplifying complex conditional logic that is dependent on an object's state.

                        The Observer Pattern is a popular behavioral design pattern used in event-driven applications where multiple objects need to stay updated with the state of a particular object or system. This pattern has two main roles, the Subject and Observer, and enables loose coupling between them, allowing for efficient broadcasting of updates to multiple observers.

                    <p>
                        The Memento Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables objects to save and restore their internal state without breaking encapsulation. This pattern is useful in situations where we need to capture an object's state at a particular time and restore it later. The pattern involves three components: the Originator, which creates and restores Memento objects, the Memento object, which contains a snapshot of the Originator's state, and the Caretaker, which stores and retrieves Memento objects. In this context, we can use the Memento Pattern to create a text editor that allows users to undo and redo their actions. By capturing the state of the document before each action, we can use the Memento Pattern to restore it if the user wants to undo the action. This approach makes it possible to create a flexible and extensible system that allows users to undo and redo their actions without breaking encapsulation.

                    <p>
                        The Mediator Pattern is a design pattern that helps to simplify the relationships between objects by promoting loose coupling between them. In this pattern, a mediator object acts as a central hub that coordinates communication between objects, eliminating direct references between them. This makes the system more maintainable and flexible.

                        The Mediator Pattern consists of several components, including the Mediator interface, Concrete Mediator, Colleague interface, and Concrete Colleague. In a chat application, for example, the Mediator Pattern can be used to create a chat room that acts as a mediator between users.

                        By using the Mediator Pattern, we can create a flexible and extensible system that promotes loose coupling between objects. We can easily modify the communication logic or add new objects without affecting the other objects. This makes the Mediator Pattern a powerful tool for simplifying communication between objects in complex systems.

                    <p>
                        The Iterator Pattern is a widely used behavioral design pattern in programming languages and frameworks that provides a way to traverse the elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation. This pattern involves two main components - an Iterator interface that defines methods for accessing and iterating over the elements of a collection, and an Aggregate interface that defines a method for creating an iterator object. By using the Iterator Pattern, we can create a flexible and extensible system that allows us to traverse collections of objects and perform operations on them. This article will provide an in-depth understanding of the Iterator Pattern, its components, and its implementation in object-oriented programming.

                        The Command Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that separates the request for a service or action from the object that actually performs the action. It encapsulates a request as an object, allowing clients to be parameterized with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations. This pattern consists of four main components: Command, Concrete Command, Invoker, and Receiver. In this article, we'll explore the Command Pattern by taking the example of a text editor that allows users to perform various operations on a document. We'll see how we can use the Command Pattern to create a flexible and extensible system that can handle different types of commands and support various operations.

                    <p>
                        The Chain of Responsibility Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a way to handle a request by creating a chain of receiver objects. Each receiver object in the chain has the ability to handle the request, and if it cannot handle the request, it passes it on to the next receiver in the chain. This pattern is useful in situations where there are multiple objects that can handle a request and the object that will handle the request is not known at runtime.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this article, we explore how the Chain of Responsibility Pattern can be used to implement an employee leave management system that has multiple levels of approval for leave requests. We create a chain of approval objects that can handle the leave request, with each object in the chain responsible for approving the request based on specific criteria. We demonstrate how this pattern can be used to create a flexible and extensible approval process that can handle different types of leave requests and reduce the coupling between the objects in the system.

                        The Proxy Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows us to provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. By using different types of proxies, such as remote proxies, virtual proxies, and protection proxies, we can enhance the functionality of the original object, control access to it, or defer its creation until it is needed. In this example of a media streaming service, we can use a VideoProxy object to control access to video content and provide additional functionality such as caching, without modifying the implementation of the VideoService object. The Proxy Pattern is a powerful tool for creating more efficient and scalable solutions.

This pattern is commonly used to extend the behavior of an object without resorting to subclassing. In this pattern, there are four main components: Component, ConcreteComponent, Decorator, and ConcreteDecorator. Using a coffee shop example, we can see how the Decorator Pattern can be used to add functionality to a basic coffee object without changing its interface. This pattern is a powerful way to enhance the flexibility and maintainability of code.

This pattern is commonly used for managing limited instances of classes like configuration managers, database connection managers, or loggers. The Singleton Pattern includes a Singleton Class, a Private Constructor, and an Instance method to create and manage the single instance of the class. We provided an example implementation of the Singleton Pattern in Java, showing how it can be used to create only one instance of a class and access it from anywhere in the application. In our next post, we'll cover the Prototype Pattern, which allows creating new objects by cloning existing objects.

                        The next blog post is a continuation of a Python3 introduction course. It will cover more advanced concepts including lists, loops and conditional statements. Lists are an essential data structure in Python that allow you to store and organize data in an ordered sequence. Loops allow you to execute a block of code multiple times, either a set number of times or until a certain condition is met. There are two types of loops in Python: <code>for</code> loops and <code>while</code> loops. Conditional statements, also known as <code>if</code> statements, allow you to execute a block of code only if a certain condition is met. The blog post will provide examples and explanations of how to use these concepts in Python. In the next lesson, the course will cover functions, which allow you to organize and reuse code.

                        In this blog post, I  discuss how to automate the process of updating your website using a shell script. 
                        I go over the steps for setting up SSH keys for your server and creating a shell script that can commit and push updates to your website's repository, log in to the server, and pull the updates. 
                        I also provide an example of the shell script in action. 
                        Finally, I introduce the concept of cronjobs and how they can be used to further automate the maintenance and management of your website.

                        Get an update on my PhD research project using machine learning to detect vault apps in the Aptoide 3rd party Android app store. 
                        The project involves scraping and collecting data from app sites, downloading and decompiling apk files, and using regular expressions to search for permissions data and imported packages. 
                        The goal is to create software to help law enforcement locate and determine how information is stored in hidden vault apps. 
                        The project is progressing well and I am excited to see the results of the machine learning program once it is trained on collected data.
