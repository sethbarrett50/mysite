                        Hello, my name is Seth Barrett. I currently attend Augusta University seeking a bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and am in my junior year. I am from Peachtree Corners, Georgia which is a suburb outside of
                        Atlanta. I am an Eagle Scout and enjoy working with or leading others towards a common objective. At Augusta University, I have been involved with the JagByte Program, the ACM club, and Delta Chi Fraternity, all of
                        which have allowed me to further network with fellow students from Augusta University and the surrounding Augusta area. There are limited opportunities for someone in the field of computer science here in the CSRA,
                        making these connections extremely valuable in my career journey.
                    </p>
                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>
                        When I was in high school, I would go with my church group to the local food bank and play with the kids of the parents waiting for assistance. Their joy taught me to make the most of my situation and persevere no
                        matter what adversity I might face. Through the completion of my Eagle Scout project, as well as leading and organizing our district's annual spring camporee for Order of the Arrow, I have honed my delegation,
                        organization, and time management skills, which has greatly benefited my ability to succeed and thrive at my time at Augusta University.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After I graduate college, I plan to pursue a career in a field of computer science. I have not decided which field yet, as I would like to try and take some of my upper-level classes and decide from there. Learning
                        SQL and Data Structures has been fun, and I can't wait to keep learning more. So far, I have expanded my knowledge of programming languages to include C#, Python, HTML, CSS, Coq, SQL, and Java during my education at
                        Augusta University, as well as valuable experience in the usage of software tools and resources including command line and terminal usage, git repositories and visual studio. I look forward to learning from an
                        internship in the future, as well as my future classes.
