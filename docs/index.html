                    Hello, my name is Seth Barrett. I currently attend Augusta University seeking a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and am in my junior year. I am from Peachtree Corners, Georgia which is a suburb outside of Atlanta. I am an Eagle Scout and enjoy working
                    with or leading others towards a common objective. At Augusta University, I have been involved with the JagByte Program, the ACM club, and Delta Chi Fraternity, all of which have allowed me to further network students from Augusta
                    University and the surrounding Augusta area. There are limited opportunities for someone in the field of computer science here, making these connections extremely valuable in my career journey.
                </p>
                <h3>About Me </h3>
                <p>
                    When I was in high school, I would go with my church group to the local food bank and play with the kids of the parents waiting for assistance. Their joy taught me to make the most of my situation and persevere no matter what adversity I might face. Through
                    the completion of my Eagle Scout project, as well as leading and organizing our district's annual spring camporee for Order of the Arrow, I have honed my delegation, organization, and time management skills, which has greatly benefited
                    my ability to succeed and thrive at my time at Augusta University.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After I graduate college, I plan to pursue a career in a field of computer science. I have not decided which field yet, as I would like to try and take some of my upper-level classes and decide from there. Learning SQL and Data Structures has been fun,
                    and I can't wait to keep learning more. So far, I have expanded my knowledge of programming languages to include C#, Python, HTML, CSS, Coq, SQL, and Java during my education at Augusta University, as well as valuable experience in
                    the usage of software tools and resources including command line and terminal usage, git repositories and visual studio. I look forward to learning from an internship in the future, as well as my future classes.
                </p>
