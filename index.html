                        Hello, my name is Seth Barrett. I recently graduated from Augusta University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and am continuing my education to attain a PhD. in Computer Science and Cyber Sciences. 
                        I am from Peachtree Corners, Georgia which is a suburb outside of Atlanta and earned my Eagle Scout. 
                        I enjoy working with or leading others toward a common objective. 
                        At Augusta University, I have been involved with the Graduate and Undergraduate Student Governments, GenCyber Camp, the Academic Success Center, undergraduate, and graduate research for the School of Computer and Cyber Sciences, the JagByte Program, the ACM club, and Delta Chi Fraternity, all of which have allowed me to further network with fellow students from Augusta University and the CSRA area. 
                        There are limited opportunities for someone in the field of computer science here in the CSRA, making these connections extremely valuable in my career journey.
                    </p>
                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>
                        When I was in high school, I would go with my church group to the local food bank and play with the kids of the parents waiting for assistance. 
                        Their joy taught me to make the most of my situation and persevere no matter what adversity I might face. 
                        Through the completion of my Eagle Scout project, as well as leading and organizing our district's annual spring camporee for Order of the Arrow, I have honed my delegation, organization, and time management skills, which has greatly benefited my ability to succeed and thrive at my time at Augusta University.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After graduation, I plan to either pursue a career in a field of computer science or continue in higher education. 
                        I particularly enjoy the cyber and machine learning fields of Computer Science, and would love to either teach or work with these in the future. 
                        My favorite classes I've taken at so far have been Artifical Intelligence and Data Structures, and I can't wait to keep expanding the sphere of my knowledge more. 
                        So far, I have expanded my knowledge of programming languages to included in my IceCream repository on Github during my education at Augusta University, as well as valuable experience in the usage of software tools and resources including command line and terminal usage, git repositories and visual studio. 
                        I look forward to learning during research, as well as my upcoming classes.
                    </p>
