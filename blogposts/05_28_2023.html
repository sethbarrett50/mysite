                    <div class='title'>Using Docker and Artifactory to Create a Container Registry: A DevOps Guide</div>

                    <p>
                        Welcome back to our DevOps series! In the previous post, we explored how to manage and distribute binary artifacts using Artifactory. In this post, we'll explore how to use Docker and Artifactory together to create a container registry.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Step 1: Creating a Docker Repository in Artifactory</h5>
                    <p>
                        To create a Docker repository in Artifactory, go to Artifactory > Admin > Repositories > Local Repositories and click "New Local Repository". Give the repository a name and select "Docker" as the package type.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Next, configure the repository settings, such as the repository key, the base URL, and the Docker API version. You can also configure access control and permissions for the repository.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once the repository is created, you can push Docker images to it using the <code>docker push</code> command.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Step 2: Configuring Docker to Use Artifactory</h5>
                    <p>
                        To configure Docker to use Artifactory, we'll need to create a Docker configuration file that specifies the Artifactory registry as the default registry.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Create a file named <code>~/.docker/config.json</code> with the following contents:
                    </p>
<p><pre>{
    "auths": {
      "ARTIFACTORY_REGISTRY": {
        "auth": "USERNAME:PASSWORD",
        "email": "EMAIL_ADDRESS"
      }
    },
    "credsStore": "desktop",
    "stackOrchestrator": "kubernetes",
    "stackMode": true
  }</pre></p>
                    <p>
                        Replace <code>ARTIFACTORY_REGISTRY, USERNAME, PASSWORD,</code> and <code>EMAIL_ADDRESS</code> with the appropriate values for your Artifactory installation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This configuration file tells Docker to use the Artifactory registry as the default registry for Docker images and specifies the authentication credentials to use.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Step 3: Pushing Docker Images to Artifactory</h5>
                    <p>
                        To push a Docker image to Artifactory, we'll need to tag the image with the Artifactory registry and push it using the <code>docker push</code> command.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, to push an image with the tag <code>my-image</code> to Artifactory, we can use the following commands:
                    </p>
<p><pre>docker tag my-image ARTIFACTORY_REGISTRY/my-image
docker push ARTIFACTORY_REGISTRY/my-image</pre></p>
                    <p>
                        This pushes the image to the Artifactory Docker repository and makes it available for distribution to other systems.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Step 4: Distributing Docker Images from Artifactory</h5>
                    <p>
                        To distribute Docker images from Artifactory to other systems, we can use the Artifactory REST API or configure other systems to pull images from the Artifactory registry.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, to pull an image with the tag <code>my-image</code> from Artifactory, we can use the following command:
                    </p>
                    <p><pre>docker pull ARTIFACTORY_REGISTRY/my-image</pre></p>
                    <p>
                        This pulls the image from the Artifactory Docker repository and makes it available for use on the local system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And that's it! With Docker and Artifactory working together, we can easily create a container registry and manage and distribute Docker images as part of our software development process. In the next post in this series, we'll explore how to use Jenkins, Docker, and Artifactory together to create a complete DevOps pipeline.
                    </p>
