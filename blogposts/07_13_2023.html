                    <p>
                        When conducting penetration testing, it's important to avoid detection and protect yourself from any potential legal or ethical repercussions. In this post, we'll cover some basic evasion techniques that you can use to avoid detection and protect yourself while conducting penetration testing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Proxy Chains<br>
                                Proxy chains involve using multiple proxy servers to route traffic through, making it difficult for network administrators to identify the source of the traffic. This can be done using tools like ProxyChains, which allows you to chain multiple proxy servers together and route traffic through them.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Spoofing<br>
                                Spoofing involves changing the source IP address of your traffic to appear as if it's coming from a different location. This can be done using tools like Scapy or by modifying network configuration files.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Encryption<br>
                                Encryption involves securing your traffic using encryption algorithms, making it difficult for network administrators to intercept and read your traffic. This can be done using tools like OpenVPN or by using encrypted communication protocols like HTTPS.  
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Steganography<br>
                                Steganography involves hiding data within other files, such as images or documents, making it difficult for network administrators to detect any suspicious activity. This can be done using tools like Steghide or by manually modifying the data within files.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Obfuscation<br>
                                Obfuscation involves hiding the true nature of your traffic or activities by disguising them as something else. This can be done using tools like the Metasploit framework, which provides various obfuscation techniques for its payloads.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's important to note that while these evasion techniques can help you avoid detection, they may also be illegal or unethical if used inappropriately. Always obtain permission from the target organization and consult with legal professionals before attempting any type of evasion technique.
