                    <p>
                        Welcome back to our series on PostGreSQL for Linux users! In our previous post, we covered the basics of setting up a PostGreSQL environment on your Linux machine. Now, we'll dive into some basic PostGreSQL commands and show you how to connect to your new database.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Step 1: Access the PostGreSQL Command Line Interface</h5>
                    <p>
                        To access the PostGreSQL command line interface, you'll need to use the psql command. Open up a terminal and enter the following command:
                    </p>
                    <p><pre>psql -d mydatabase -U myuser</pre></p>
                    <p>
                        Replace "mydatabase" and "myuser" with the name of the database and the user you created in the previous post.
                    </p>
                    <p>Once you've entered this command, you'll be prompted to enter the password for your PostGreSQL user. After you've entered your password, you'll be connected to your PostGreSQL database.</p>
                    <h5>Step 2: Create a Table</h5>
                    <p>
                        Now that you're connected to your PostGreSQL database, let's create a table to store some data. Here's an example table definition:
                    </p>
<p><pre>CREATE TABLE people (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    age INT,
    email VARCHAR(100)
);</pre></p>
                    <p>Enter this command into the PostGreSQL command line interface to create a new table called "people" with four columns: "id", "name", "age", and "email".</p>
                    <h5>Step 3: Insert Data into the Table</h5>
                    <p>Now that you have a table, let's add some data to it. Here's an example command to insert a new row into the "people" table:</p>
                    <p><pre>INSERT INTO people (name, age, email) VALUES ('John Doe', 30, 'john.doe@example.com');</pre></p>
                    <p>This command will insert a new row into the "people" table with the name "John Doe", age 30, and email address "john.doe@example.com".</p>
                    <h5>Step 4: Retrieve Data from the Table</h5>
                    <p>
                        To retrieve data from the "people" table, you can use the <code>SELECT</code> command. Here's an example command to retrieve all rows from the "people" table:
                    </p>
                    <p><pre>SELECT * FROM people;</pre></p>
                    <p>
                        This command will retrieve all rows from the "people" table and display them in the PostGreSQL command line interface.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That's it for this post! In the next post in this series, we'll cover some more advanced PostGreSQL commands and show you how to interact with your database using Python.
