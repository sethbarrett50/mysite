                    <div class='title'>Go Programming Basics: Syntax and Unique Features</div>

                    <p>
                        Welcome back to our Go programming series! In our previous post, we set up our coding environment on Linux and created a Go workspace. Now that we're all set up, let's dive into the basics of Go syntax and some of its unique features.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Hello, World!</h5>
                    <p>
                        Let's start by creating our first Go program, the traditional "Hello, World!" program. Open up your favorite text editor and create a new file called <code>hello.go</code> in your workspace directory <code>($HOME/go/src)</code>:
                    </p>
<p><pre>package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}</pre></p>
                    <p>
                        The first line <code>package main</code> tells Go that this is a main package, and the entry point of the program will be the <code>main()</code> function.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Next, we import the <code>fmt</code> package, which provides functions for formatting text.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In our <code>main()</code> function, we call the <code>Println()</code> function from the <code>fmt</code> package to print the string "Hello, World!" to the console.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, let's compile and run our program. Open up a terminal, navigate to your workspace directory, and run the following commands:
                    </p>
<p><pre>cd $HOME/go/src
go build hello.go
./hello</pre></p>
                    <p>
                        The <code>go build</code> command compiles our Go code into an executable binary file, which we can run using the <code>./hello</code> command.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Variables && Types</h5>
                    <p>
                        Go is a statically typed language, which means that variables must be declared with their type at compile time. Here's an example of declaring and initializing variables in Go:
                    </p>
<p><pre>package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    var a int = 5
    var b float64 = 3.14
    var c string = "Hello, World!"
    
    fmt.Printf("a = %d\n", a)
    fmt.Printf("b = %f\n", b)
    fmt.Printf("c = %s\n", c)
}</pre></p>
                    <p>
                        In this example, we declare three variables <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code> with their types <code>int</code>, <code>float64</code>, and <code>string</code>, respectively. We initialize each variable with a value.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We use the <code>fmt.Printf()</code> function to print the value of each variable. The <code>%d</code>, <code>%f</code>, and <code>%s</code> format specifiers tell Go to print the values in decimal, float, and string formats, respectively.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Structs</h5>
                    <p>
                        In Go, structs are used to define custom data types. Here's an example of defining and using a struct:
                    </p>
<p><pre>package main

import "fmt"

type person struct {
    name string
    age int
}

func main() {
    p := person{name: "John", age: 30}
    fmt.Printf("Name: %s, Age: %d\n", p.name, p.age)
}</pre></p>
                    <p>
                        In this example, we define a <code>person</code> struct with two fields: <code>name</code> of type <code>string</code> and <code>age</code> of type <code>int</code>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We create a new <code>person</code> struct instance <code>p</code> and initialize its <code>name</code> and <code>age</code> fields using the syntax <code>p := person{name: "John", age: 30}</code>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We use the <code>fmt.Printf()</code> function to print the <code>name</code> and <code>age</code> fields of the <code>p</code> struct instance.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                    <p>
                        In this post, we covered the basics of Go syntax and some of its unique features, including variables and types, and structs. In the next post, we'll dive deeper into Go's control structures and functions. Stay tuned!
