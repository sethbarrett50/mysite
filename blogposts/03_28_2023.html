                    <div class='title'>Minimizing Memory Usage with the Flyweight Pattern: A Structural Design Pattern</div>

                    <p>
                        The Flyweight Pattern is a structural design pattern that is used to minimize memory usage by sharing data between multiple similar objects. The pattern achieves this by separating the intrinsic and extrinsic state of an object. The intrinsic state is the part of the object that is common between multiple instances of the same type, while the extrinsic state is the part that varies between instances.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Flyweight Pattern consists of two main components: the <code>FlyweightFactory</code> and the <code>Flyweight</code> objects. The FlyweightFactory is responsible for managing and creating <code>Flyweight</code> objects, while the <code>Flyweight</code> objects are the shared objects that store the intrinsic state.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let's take an example of a drawing application that allows users to draw shapes on a canvas. The application allows users to draw circles, squares, and rectangles. Each shape has its own set of properties such as color, size, and position.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Without the Flyweight Pattern, the application would create a new object for each shape drawn on the canvas, resulting in a large memory usage. By using the Flyweight Pattern, we can create a single <code>Shape</code> object for each shape type and share it between all instances of the same type.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <code>ShapeFactory</code> is the <code>FlyweightFactory</code> in this example. It is responsible for creating and managing the <code>Shape</code> objects. When a user requests to draw a shape, the <code>ShapeFactory</code> checks if a <code>Shape</code> object with the same intrinsic state already exists. If it does, the <code>ShapeFactory</code> returns the existing object. If it doesn't, the <code>ShapeFactory</code> creates a new <code>Shape</code> object and adds it to its internal collection.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <code>Shape</code> objects are the <code>Flyweight</code> objects in this example. They store the intrinsic state of the shapes such as color and size. The extrinsic state, which varies between instances, is stored in the <code>draw()</code> method of the <code>Shape</code> object. This method takes a <code>Canvas</code> object as a parameter and draws the shape on the canvas at the specified position.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By using the Flyweight Pattern, we can reduce the memory usage of the application by sharing data between multiple similar objects. This results in a more efficient and scalable application.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In conclusion, the Flyweight Pattern is a powerful structural design pattern that allows us to minimize memory usage by sharing data between similar objects. By separating the intrinsic and extrinsic state of an object, we can create more efficient and scalable applications.
                    </p>
