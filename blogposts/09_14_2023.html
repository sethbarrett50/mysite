                    <p>
                        Welcome to the thirteenth installment of our "Getting Started with Zig on MacOS" series. In this part, we'll explore the topic of interoperability in Zig, which involves using C libraries in Zig, leveraging Zig's C-compatible ABI, and calling Zig code from other programming languages.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Using C Libraries in Zig</h5>
                    <p>
                        Zig has strong support for interoperability with C libraries, making it easy to integrate existing C code into your Zig projects. To use a C library in Zig, you typically follow these steps:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Include Headers: Include the necessary C library headers using the <code>@cInclude</code> directive.</li>
                            <li>Link C Libraries: Link the C library's binary object files (<code>.o</code> or <code>.a</code> files) during the build process.</li>
                            <li>Declare C Functions: Declare C functions in Zig using the <code>@cImport</code> directive to access them from Zig code.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </p>
                    <p>Here's a simplified example of using the C standard library's <code>printfprintf</code> function in Zig:</p>
<p><pre>const std = @import("std");

const libc = @cImport({
    @cInclude("stdio.h");
});

fn main() void {
    const message = "Hello, Zig!\n";
    libc.printf("%s", .{@cstring(message)});
}</pre></p>
                    <p>In this example, we import the C standard library's <code>printf</code> function and use it to print a message.</p>
                    <h5>Zig's C-Compatible ABI</h5>
                    <p>
                        Zig is designed to have a C-compatible ABI, which means you can call Zig functions from C and vice versa. This compatibility simplifies integration with other languages and systems that use C as a common interface.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To expose Zig functions for use in C code, you can mark them with the <code>@cDefine</code> attribute. For example:
                    </p>
<p><pre>const std = @import("std");

@cDefine
pub fn add(a: i32, b: i32) i32 {
    return a + b;
}</pre></p>
                    <p>This allows you to call the <code>add</code> function from C code as if it were a regular C function.</p>
                    <h5>Calling Zig from Other Languages</h5>
                    <p>
                        Zig's C-compatible ABI also enables you to call Zig code from other programming languages like C, C++, and even languages with foreign function interfaces (FFI). To do this, you need to create a Zig library that exports functions using the <code>@cDefine</code> attribute and then link it with the target language.
                    </p>
                    <p>Here's an example of using a Zig function from a C program:</p>
<p><pre>const std = @import("std");

@cDefine
pub fn zig_add(a: i32, b: i32) i32 {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    int result = zig_add(3, 4);
    printf("Result: %d\n", result);
    return 0;
}</pre></p>
                    <p>In this example, we define a Zig function <code>zig_add</code> and call it from a C program.</p>
                    <h5>What's Next?</h5>
                    <p>
                        In this part, you've learned about interoperability in Zig, including using C libraries in Zig, Zig's C-compatible ABI, and calling Zig code from other programming languages. Zig's compatibility with C opens up a wide range of possibilities for integrating existing codebases, libraries, and languages into your Zig projects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As you continue to explore Zig, consider how these interoperability features can help you leverage the extensive ecosystem of C libraries and work seamlessly with other programming languages. Happy coding!
