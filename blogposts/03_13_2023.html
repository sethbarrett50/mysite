                    <div class='title'>Testing Your Racket Code: A Comprehensive Guide to Unit and Integration Testing</div>
                    <h5>Racket's Support for Testing</h5>
                    <p>
                        Racket provides a comprehensive framework for testing your code, including support for both unit testing and integration testing. 
                        The framework is built on top of the <code>rackunit</code> library, which provides a wide range of tools for testing and debugging your Racket programs.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Unit Testing with Racket</h5>
                    <p>
                        Racket's unit testing framework is based on the concept of a test case, which is a function that checks whether some aspect of your code behaves as expected. 
                        A test case typically consists of one or more assertions, which verify that a certain condition holds true. 
                        For example, you might write a test case that checks whether a function returns the correct output for a given input.
                    </p>
                    <p>Here's an example of a simple test case in Racket:</p>
<p><pre>#lang racket

(require rackunit)

(define (test-my-function)
    (check-equal? (my-function 2) 4)
    (check-equal? (my-function -3) 9))</pre></p>
                    <p>
                        In this example, we define a test case called <code>test-my-function</code> that checks whether the <code>my-function</code> function returns the correct output for two different inputs. 
                        We use the <code>check-equal?</code> assertion to compare the output of <code>my-function</code> to the expected value.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Integration Testing with Racket</h5>
                    <p>
                        Integration testing is the process of testing how different components of your application work together. 
                        In Racket, you can use the <code>web-server/testing</code> library to write integration tests for your web applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>Here's an example of a simple integration test in Racket:</p>
<p><pre>#lang racket

(require web-server/testing)

(define (test-my-web-app)
    (with-handlers ([exn:fail? (lambda (exn) (void))])
    (run-server-tests
        (list
        (test-post "/submit" "name=John&email=john@example.com"
                    (λ (response)
                    (check-equal? (response-status response) 200)
                    (check-true (string-contains? (response-body/response response)
                                                    "Thank you for submitting your information!"))))
        (test-get "/contact"
                    (λ (response)
                    (check-equal? (response-status response) 200)
                    (check-true (string-contains? (response-body/response response)
                                                    "Contact Us"))))))))

(test-my-web-app)
</pre></p>
                    <p>
                        In this example, we define an integration test called <code>test-my-web-app</code> that tests two different endpoints of a web application. 
                        We use the <code>test-post</code> and <code>test-get</code> functions to simulate HTTP requests to the <code>/submit</code> and <code>/contact</code> endpoints, respectively. 
                        We use the <code>check-equal?</code> and <code>check-true</code> assertions to verify that the HTTP response contains the expected content.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                    <p>
                        Racket's built-in support for testing makes it easy to write robust and reliable code. 
                        The <code>rackunit</code> library provides a comprehensive set of tools for unit testing, while the <code>web-server/testing</code> library provides a simple way to write integration tests for your web applications. 
                        With Racket's support for testing, you can be confident that your code works as expected, even as it grows in complexity.
                    </p>
