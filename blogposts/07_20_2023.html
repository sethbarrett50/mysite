                    <p>
                        Welcome back to our SQL blog series! In the last post, we covered how to create a database and table using SQL, and how to insert data into a table using the INSERT INTO command. In this post, we will cover how to retrieve data from a table using the SELECT command.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Retrieving Data from a Table</h5>
                    <p>
                        To retrieve data from a table using SQL, you can use the SELECT command. Here's an example:
                    </p>
                    <p><pre>SELECT * FROM mytable;</pre></p>
                    <p>
                        This command selects all columns and rows from the "mytable" table. The asterisk (*) represents all columns in the table. You can also select specific columns by listing them after the SELECT keyword. Here's an example:
                    </p>
                    <p><pre>SELECT id, name FROM mytable;</pre></p>
                    <p>
                        This command selects only the "id" and "name" columns from the "mytable" table.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Filtering Data</h5>
                    <p>
                        You can also filter the data retrieved from a table using the WHERE clause. Here's an example:
                    </p>
                    <p><pre>SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE age > 18;</pre></p>
                    <p>
                        This command selects all columns and rows from the "mytable" table where the "age" column is greater than 18.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Sorting Data</h5>
                    <p>
                        You can also sort the data retrieved from a table using the ORDER BY clause. Here's an example:
                    </p>
                    <p><pre>SELECT * FROM mytable ORDER BY name ASC;</pre></p>
                    <p>
                        This command selects all columns and rows from the "mytable" table and sorts them in ascending order by the "name" column.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Limiting Data</h5>
                    <p>
                        You can limit the data retrieved from a table using the LIMIT clause. Here's an example:
                    </p>
                    <p><pre>SELECT * FROM mytable LIMIT 5;</pre></p>
                    <p>
                        This command selects the first 5 rows from the "mytable" table.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                    <p>
                        In this post, we covered how to retrieve data from a table using the SELECT command. We also covered how to filter, sort, and limit the data retrieved from a table using the WHERE, ORDER BY, and LIMIT clauses. In the next post, we will cover how to update data in a table using the UPDATE command. Stay tuned!
                    </p>
