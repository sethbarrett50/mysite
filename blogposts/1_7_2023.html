                    <p>
                        Welcome back to our Python3 intro course! 
                        In the last lesson, we covered how to set up your Python environment and create your first Python program. 
                        In this lesson, we'll delve deeper into using variables and data types in Python.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A variable is a named container for storing data. 
                        In Python, you can create a variable by simply assigning a value to it using the assignment operator `=`. 
                        For example:
                    </p>
                    <p><pre>
                        x = 5
                        y = "hello"
                    </pre>
                    <p>
                        Here, we've created two variables: `x`, which contains the integer value 5, and `y`, which contains the string "hello".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Python has several built-in data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and Booleans.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An integer is a whole number, either positive or negative. 
                        For example:
                    </p>
                    <p><pre>
                        x = 5
                        y = -10
                    </pre></p>
                    <p>
                        A floating-point number is a number with a decimal point. 
                        For example:
                    </p>
                    <p><pre>
                        x = 3.14
                        y = -2.718
                    </pre></p>
                    <p>
                        A string is a sequence of characters, either letters, numbers, or symbols, enclosed in either single or double quotation marks. 
                        For example:
                    </p>
                    <p><pre>
                        x = "hello"
                        y = '12345'
                    </pre></p>
                    <p>
                        A Boolean is a data type that can have only two values: `True` or `False`. 
                        For example:
                    </p>
                    <p><pre>
                        x = True
                        y = False
                    </pre></p>
                    <p>
                        You can also use the `type()` function to check the data type of a variable. 
                        For example:
                    </p>
                    <p><pre>
                        x = 5
                        print(type(x))  
                        # Output: &lt;class 'int'&gt;

                        y = "hello"
                        print(type(y)) 
                        # Output: &lt;class 'str'&gt;
                    </pre></p>
                    <p>
                        It's important to use the appropriate data type for your variables, as this can affect how your program behaves. 
                        For example, if you try to perform arithmetic operations on a string, you'll get an error.
                    </p>
                    <p><pre>
                        x = "hello"
                        y = 5
                        print(x + y)  
                        # Output: TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
                    </pre></p>
                    <p>
                        To avoid this, you can use type conversion functions to convert variables to the desired data type. 
                        For example:
                    </p>
                    <p><pre>
                        x = "5"
                        y = int(x)  
                        # y is now the integer 5

                        x = 5
                        y = str(x)  
                        # y is now the string "5"
                    </pre></p>
                    <p>
                        I hope this has been a helpful introduction to using variables and data types in Python. 
                        In the next lesson, we'll look at more advanced concepts such as loops and conditional statements. 
                        Stay tuned!
                    </p>

                    <!-- Desc: Welcome to the second lesson in our Python3 intro course! In this lesson, we'll be diving into the basics of using variables and data types in Python. We'll cover what variables are and how to create them, as well as the different built-in data types available in Python, such as integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and Booleans. We'll also learn how to use the type() function to check the data type of a variable and how to use type conversion functions to change a variable's data type. Don't worry if this all seems a bit overwhelming – we'll be practicing these concepts as we go along, so you'll get plenty of hands-on experience. Stay tuned for the next lesson, where we'll be covering loops and conditional statements! -->
