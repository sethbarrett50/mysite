                    <div class='title'>A Comprehensive Guide to Go Programming on Linux: Recap and Further Learning Resources</div>

                    <p>
                        Welcome back to our Go programming series! In our previous post, we covered how to integrate <code>pgx</code> into Gin and build a simple CRUD API for managing users in our PostgreSQL database. Now, let's wrap up this series by summarizing what we've learned and discussing some resources for further learning.            
                    </p>
                    <h5>Summary</h5>

                    <p><ol>
                        <li>Setting up a Go coding environment on Linux</li>
                        <li>Basic Go programming concepts, syntax, and unique features</li>
                        <li>Go structs and methods</li>
                        <li>Go concurrency using goroutines and channels</li>
