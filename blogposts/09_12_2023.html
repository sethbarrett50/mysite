                    <p>
                        Welcome to the eleventh installment of our "Getting Started with Zig on MacOS" series. In this part, we'll dive into concurrency in Zig, a crucial topic for writing efficient and parallelized programs. Zig provides various concurrency features, including coroutines, async/await, message-passing concurrency, and low-level synchronization primitives like mutexes and atomics.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Coroutines and Async/Await</h5>
                    <p>
                        Coroutines in Zig allow you to write asynchronous, non-blocking code using the <code>async</code> and <code>await</code> keywords. An <code>async</code> function can be paused and resumed without blocking the entire program. Here's an example of using <code>async</code> and <code>await</code>:
                    </p>
<p><pre>const std = @import("std");

async fn fetchData(url: []const u8) ![]const u8 {
    const result = try std.net.httpClient().get(url);
    return result.body;
}

fn main() void {
    const url = "https://example.com";

    const fiber = @import("std").fiber;
    const result = fiber.run(async {
        const data = try fetchData(url);
        std.debug.print("Received data: {}\n", .{data});
        return "Done";
    });

    std.debug.print("Fiber result: {}\n", .{result});
}</pre></p>
                    <p>
                        In this example:
                        <ul>
                            <li>We define an <code>async</code> function <code>fetchData</code> that fetches data from a URL using the Zig standard library's HTTP client.</li>
                            <li>In the <code>main</code> function, we use Zig's fibers to run the asynchronous code and print the result.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h5>Message-Passing Concurrency</h5>
                    <p>
                        Zig supports message-passing concurrency through channels. Channels allow different parts of your program to communicate by sending and receiving messages. Here's an example of using channels for concurrency:
                    </p>
<p><pre>const std = @import("std");

fn worker(channel: *std.mem.Channel(i32)) void {
    while (true) {
        const message = channel.receive();
        if (message == -1) {
            break;
        }
        std.debug.print("Received message: {}\n", .{message});
    }
}

fn main() void {
    const channel = std.mem.Channel(i32).init(16);
    const thread = @import("std").thread;

    thread.spawn(worker, &channel);

    for (var i: i32 = 0; i &lt; 10; i += 1) {
        channel.send(i);
    }
    channel.send(-1);

    thread.join(thread.current());
}</pre></p>
                    <p>
                        In this example:
                        <ul>
                            <li>We create a channel that can transmit <code>i32</code> values.</li>
                            <li>We spawn a worker thread that receives messages from the channel and processes them.</li>
                            <li>In the <code>main</code> function, we send a sequence of <code>i32</code> values to the worker and signal it to stop by sending <code>-1</code>.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h5>Mutexes and Atomics</h5>
                    <p>
                        For low-level synchronization, Zig provides mutexes and atomic operations. Mutexes are used to protect critical sections of code from concurrent access, while atomic operations provide thread-safe read-modify-write operations on variables. Here's a basic example using a mutex:
                    </p>
<p><pre>const std = @import("std");

var sharedCounter: i32 = 0;
const mutex = std.concurrent.Mutex.init;

fn incrementCounter() void {
    mutex.lock();
    defer mutex.unlock();

    sharedCounter += 1;
}

fn main() void {
    const thread = @import("std").thread;

    const numThreads: usize = 4;
    var threads: [numThreads]thread.Thread = undefined;

    for (var i: usize = 0; i &lt; numThreads; i += 1) {
        threads[i].spawn(incrementCounter);
    }

    for (var i: usize = 0; i &lt; numThreads; i += 1) {
        thread.join(&threads[i]);
    }

    std.debug.print("Shared counter: {}\n", .{sharedCounter});
}</pre></p>
                    <p>
                        In this example:
                        <ul>
                            <li>We define a shared counter and protect it with a mutex to ensure safe concurrent access.</li>
                            <li>WMultiple threads increment the shared counter, and we use mutexes to prevent data races.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h5>What's Next?</h5>
                    <p>
