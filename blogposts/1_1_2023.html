                    <p>
                        Hello everyone!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm excited to share my plans for my personal blog and server in the new year. 
                        I'm committed to writing a blog post every day in 2023, and I'm really looking forward to sharing my thoughts, experiences, and insights with all of you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order to make the blog as accessible and user-friendly as possible, I'm planning to create individual web pages for each blog post. 
                        This will make it easier for readers to find and access specific posts, and it will help to keep the blog organized and easy to navigate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm also planning to make the blog the first page that is accessed when someone visits my site. 
                        Currently, the index page is the first thing that visitors see, but I want to change that so that the blog is the first thing that people see when they visit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to these changes, I'm planning to source my images more carefully and make sure to size them correctly using scripts. 
                        I'm also going to make sure to include sources for all of my blog posts, particularly for any photos or external sites that I reference.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm also going to work on adding better links to other sites throughout my blog. 
                        This will help to create a more connected and cohesive experience for readers, and it will make it easier for them to explore related content.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, I'm planning to fix and perfect my email server, and I'll be writing a blog post about that process as well. 
                        And, in the spirit of sharing my research and knowledge, I'm also planning to write more posts about the research that I'm doing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Overall, I'm excited to make these improvements to my blog and server and to continue sharing my thoughts and experiences with all of you in the new year. 
                        Stay tuned!
                    </p>
