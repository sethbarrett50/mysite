                    <p>
                        Welcome back to our Advanced Machine Learning series! In this blog post, we'll explore the dynamic realm of Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Continuous Actions, where AI agents navigate complex environments by making precise and continuous decisions.
                    </p>
                    <h5>The Challenge of Continuous Action Spaces</h5>
                    <p>
                        In many real-world scenarios, AI agents need to perform actions with continuous values, such as controlling a robotic arm or steering an autonomous vehicle. RL with Continuous Actions tackles the challenge of learning optimal policies in such continuous action spaces.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Key Techniques in Reinforcement Learning with Continuous Actions</h5>
                    <p><ol>
                        <li><b>Policy Gradients:</b>
                            Policy Gradients is a popular approach in RL with Continuous Actions. It involves directly optimizing the policy function to maximize the expected rewards. Gradient-based optimization techniques, such as stochastic gradient descent, are used to update the policy parameters.</li>
                        <li><b>Actor-Critic Methods:</b>
                            Actor-Critic methods combine the advantages of both value-based (Critic) and policy-based (Actor) RL. The Critic estimates the value function, providing guidance to the Actor for improving the policy. This two-component architecture enhances the stability and efficiency of the learning process.</li>
                        <li><b>Deterministic Policy Gradients (DPG):</b>
                            DPG is an extension of Policy Gradients for deterministic policies. Instead of learning a stochastic policy, DPG aims to learn a deterministic mapping from states to actions. This approach is beneficial in applications where determinism is desirable, such as robotic control.</li>
                    </ol></p>
                    <h5>Applications of Reinforcement Learning with Continuous Actions</h5>
                    <p>
                        RL with Continuous Actions finds applications in various domains, including:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Robotics: </b>
                                AI agents control robotic arms and perform precise manipulation tasks in complex environments.</li>
                            <li><b>Autonomous Vehicles: </b>
                                RL enables autonomous vehicles to make continuous steering and speed decisions for safe and efficient navigation.</li>
                            <li><b>Process Control: </b>
                                RL with continuous actions is used to optimize processes and control systems in manufacturing and industry.</li>
                            <li><b>Finance: </b>
                                AI agents make continuous decisions in portfolio optimization and trading strategies.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h5>Implementing Reinforcement Learning with Continuous Actions with Julia and Flux.jl</h5>
                    <p>Let's explore how to implement Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG) with Julia and Flux.jl.</p>

        Dense(128, 64, relu),
        Dense(64, output_dim)
    )
end

# Define the DDPG model
function DDPG(actor, critic, target_actor, target_critic, γ, τ)
    return actor, critic, target_actor, target_critic, γ, τ
end

# Define the DDPG loss function
function ddpg_loss(actor, critic, target_actor, target_critic, state, action, reward, next_state, done)
    next_action = target_actor(next_state)
    q_value = reward + γ * target_critic(next_state, next_action) * (1 - done)
    actor_loss = -mean(critic(state, actor(state)))
    critic_loss = mse(critic(state, action), q_value)

    return actor_loss, critic_loss
end</pre></p>
