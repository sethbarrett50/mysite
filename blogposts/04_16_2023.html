                    <p>
                        In the previous post, we showed you how to use Git to manage your Java project on Linux. In this post, we'll guide you through the process of using continuous integration with Jenkins to automate your build and test process for your Java project.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Step 1: Install Jenkins</h5>
                    <p>
                        To install Jenkins on your Linux system, you can follow the official Jenkins installation guide for Linux. Once Jenkins is installed, you can access the Jenkins web interface by navigating to <a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a> in your web browser.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Step 2: Configure Jenkins</h5>
                    <p>
                        To configure Jenkins for your Java project, you'll need to create a new Jenkins job. From the Jenkins home page, click "New Item" and enter a name for your job. Choose "Freestyle project" and click "OK."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the configuration page for your job, go to the "Source Code Management" section and choose "Git." Enter the URL for your Git repository and choose the branch you want to build.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the "Build" section, click "Add build step" and choose "Invoke top-level Maven targets." In the "Goals" field, enter "clean package." This will clean your project, compile your Java code, run your tests, and package your application into a JAR file.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Step 3: Build Your Project</h5>
                    <p>
                        To build your project using Jenkins, click "Build Now" from the Jenkins home page. Jenkins will start a new build and display the build status in the build history.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Step 4: View Your Build Results</h5>
                    <p>
                        To view the results of your build, click on the build number in the build history. This will display the console output for your build, as well as the test results.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Congratulations! You've successfully set up continuous integration with Jenkins to automate your build and test process for your Java project. In the next post, we'll explore how to deploy your Java application to a web server.
                    </p>
