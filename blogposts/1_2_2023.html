                    <p>
                        Hello everyone,
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I wanted to share with you a tool that I have found extremely helpful in my work as a programmer and system administrator. 
                        <a href="https://regex101.com/">That tool is RegEx101, an online resource that helps me generate regular expressions for a variety of programming languages and use cases, found here.
                        </a>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For those who may not be familiar, regular expressions (also known as "regex" or "regexp") are a powerful way to search and manipulate text. 
                        They are used in many programming languages and are an essential skill for anyone working with data or text processing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        RegEx101 is an excellent resource for anyone looking to create or work with regular expressions. 
                        It supports a wide range of programming languages, including AutoIt, C#, Golang, Java, JavaScript, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Rust, SED, and Swift 5.2. 
                        Not only can it generate code based on each language's regex syntax, but it also supports various use cases such as matching, substitutions, lists, and unit tests.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have found RegEx101 to be an invaluable resource in my projects, including my research on Vault and IoT device security. 
                        It has helped me create complex regular expressions that are over 200 characters in length, and the SED generator has even been useful for grep and awk in my server maintenance work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to its code generation capabilities, RegEx101 also includes a quick reference guide that explains the different parts of a regex language, such as tokens, anchors, meta sequences, quantifiers, character classes, flags, and modifiers. 
                        This has helped me better understand the different components of a regex and how they work together.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of my favorite features of RegEx101 is its ability to test a regex against a sample string. 
                        This allows me to see exactly how my regex is matching the string and which groups are being captured. 
                        It also provides a detailed explanation of each character and sequence in the regex, making it a great learning tool as well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In short, RegEx101 is an essential resource for anyone working with regular expressions, whether you're a seasoned programmer or just starting out. 
                        I highly recommend giving it a try if you're looking to improve your regex skills or just need a quick and easy way to generate regex code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Thanks for reading, and I hope this has been helpful!
                    </p>

                    <!-- Desc: In this blog post, I'll be sharing how I use the website RegEx101 to help me generate regular expressions. From supporting multiple programming languages to offering a quick reference guide and the ability to test your regular expressions against a test string, RegEx101 has become an invaluable resource for me in both my programming and system administration work.
