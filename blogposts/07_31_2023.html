                    <div class='title'>Mastering Dependency Management in Kotlin with Gradle: A Comprehensive Guide</div>

                    <p>
                        In this post, we'll cover how to manage dependencies in Kotlin using Gradle.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Gradle is a build automation tool that is commonly used in Kotlin projects. It makes it easy to manage dependencies, build your project, and run tests.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Setting up Gradle</h5>
                    <p>
                        To use Gradle in your Kotlin project, you'll need to add the Gradle plugin to your build.gradle file:
                    </p>
<p><pre>plugins {
    id 'org.jetbrains.kotlin.jvm' version '1.6.3'
    id 'application'
}</pre></p>
                    <p>
                        You'll also need to define the dependencies for your project. Here's an example of how to define a dependency on the Ktor server:
                    </p>
<p><pre>dependencies {
    implementation "io.ktor:ktor-server-netty:$ktor_version"
}</pre></p>
                    <p>You'll need to define the <code>ktor_version</code> in your gradle.properties file:</p>
                    <p><pre>ktor_version=1.6.3</pre></p>
                    <h5>Managing Dependencies</h5>
                    <p>
                        Gradle makes it easy to manage dependencies in your Kotlin project. You can define dependencies using the <code>dependencies</code> block in your build.gradle file, and Gradle will automatically download the dependencies and make them available in your project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here's an example of how to define a dependency on the Ktor server and the MySQL driver:
                    </p>
<p><pre>dependencies {
    implementation "io.ktor:ktor-server-netty:$ktor_version"
    implementation "mysql:mysql-connector-java:8.0.27"
}</pre></p>
                    <p>
                        This defines a dependency on the Ktor server and the MySQL driver, which will be downloaded and made available in your project.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Building and Running Your Project</h5>
                    <p>
                        Once you have your dependencies defined, you can use Gradle to build and run your project. You can use the <code>run</code> task to start your application:
                    </p>
                    <p><pre>./gradlew run</pre></p>
                    <p>This will start your application and listen on the port defined in your code.</p>
                    <p>You can also use the <code>build</code> task to build your project:</p>
                    <p><pre>./gradlew build</pre></p>
                    <p>This will compile your code, run tests, and create a JAR file that you can use to run your application.</p>
                    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                    <p>That's it for this post! We covered how to manage dependencies in Kotlin using Gradle. In the final post of this series, we'll wrap things up and provide some resources for further learning.</p>
