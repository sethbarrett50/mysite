                    <p>
                        Welcome back to our SQL blog series! This is the final post in our series, and we want to thank you for following along. In this post, we will summarize what we've covered and provide some resources for further learning.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Summary</h5>
                    <p>
                        In this series, we covered the basics of SQL, including how to create a database and table, insert data into a table, retrieve data from a table using the SELECT command, update data in a table using the UPDATE command, and delete data from a table using the DELETE command. We also covered how to use prepared statements in SQL to help prevent SQL injection attacks, and how to connect to a MySQL database using PHP and the PDO extension. Finally, we demonstrated how to use PHP to create a simple web application that interacts with a MySQL database.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By following this series, you should now have a good understanding of the basics of SQL and how to use it to interact with a MySQL database.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Further Learning</h5>
                    <p>
