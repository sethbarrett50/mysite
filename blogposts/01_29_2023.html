                    <p>
                        The <code>typing</code> module in Python is a module for working with type hints. 
                        Type hints are a way to indicate the type of a variable, function, or method in Python, allowing for improved code readability, better error checking and more efficient code execution.
                        They also allow you, the programmer, to gain a better insight on how datatyping works in languages, and this skill transfers over to most other programming languages as well. 
                        In this post, we will take a look at some of the most commonly used methods of the <code>typing</code> module and how they can be used to improve the quality of your code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <code>typing</code> module provides a number of different types that can be used to indicate the type of a variable, function, or method. 
                        For example, the <code>List</code> type can be used to indicate that a variable is a list of a specific type of elements. 
                        Here's an example of how to use the <code>List</code> type:
                    </p>
<p><pre>from typing import List

def add_numbers(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    return sum(numbers)

print(add_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])) # Output: 15
print(add_numbers([1, 2, '3', 4, 5])) # Output: TypeError</pre></p>
                    <p>
                        In this example, we use the <code>List</code> type to indicate that the <code>numbers</code> argument of the <code>add_numbers</code> function is a list of integers. 
                        We also use the <code>-></code> syntax to indicate that the function returns an integer. 
                        If we try to pass a list that contains elements of a different type to the function, we'll get a <code>TypeError</code>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another useful type provided by the <code>typing</code> module is the <code>Tuple</code> type. 
                        This type can be used to indicate that a variable is a tuple of specific types. 
                        Here's an example of how to use the <code>Tuple</code> type:
                    </p>
<p><pre>from typing import Tuple

def add_numbers(numbers: Tuple[int, int]) -> int:
    return sum(numbers)

print(add_numbers((1, 2))) # Output: 3
print(add_numbers((1, '2'))) # Output: TypeError</pre></p>
                    <p>
                        In this example, we use the <code>Tuple</code> type to indicate that the <code>numbers</code> argument of the <code>add_numbers</code> function is a tuple of two integers. 
                        If we try to pass a tuple that contains elements of a different type to the function, we'll get a <code>TypeError</code>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another type provided by the <code>typing</code> module is the <code>Union</code> type. 
                        It allows you to indicate that a variable can be of one of multiple types. 
                        Here's an example of how to use the <code>Union</code> type:
                    </p>
<p><pre>from typing import Union

def add(a: Union[int,float], b: Union[int,float])-> Union[int,float]:
    return a+b

print(add(1, 2)) # Output: 3
print(add(1.1, 2)) # Output: 3.1</pre></p>
                    <p>
                        In this example, we use the <code>Union</code> type to indicate that the <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> arguments of the <code>add</code> function can be of type <code>int</code> or <code>float</code> and the function will return the same type.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In summary, the <code>typing</code> module in Python provides a way to improve the quality of your code by indicating the type of a variable, function, or method. 
                        This allows for improved code readability, better error checking, and more efficient code execution. 
                        The <code>typing</code> module provides a number of different types, such as <code>List</code>, <code>Tuple</code>, <code>Union</code> and many others, that can be used to indicate the type of a variable, function or method. 
                        By using these types, you can ensure that your code is more robust and less prone to errors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's worth noting that while using type hints is not required in Python, it is a best practice to use them. 
                        Type hints make your code more readable and self-documenting, making it easier for others to understand and maintain your code. 
                        Additionally, using type hints can also improve the performance of your code, by enabling the use of type-specific optimization techniques.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In conclusion, the <code>typing</code> module in Python is a powerful tool that allows you to improve the quality of your code by indicating the type of a variable, function, or method. 
                        By using type hints, you can make your code more robust, readable, and efficient. 
                        Understanding and using the <code>typing</code> module is an essential part of creating high-quality Python code.
                    </p>
