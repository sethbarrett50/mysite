                    <div class='title'>Starting with Kotlin: A Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Up Your Coding Environment on Linux</div>

                    <p>
                        Starting off with setting up a coding environment is a perfect way to begin your Kotlin tutorial series. In this post, we'll cover everything you need to know about setting up a coding environment for Kotlin on Linux.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before we dive in, let's make sure you have everything you need:
                        <ul>
                            <li>A Linux machine (Ubuntu, Fedora, or any other distribution)</li>
                            <li>A text editor of your choice (we recommend IntelliJ IDEA, but you can use any text editor or IDE that supports Kotlin)</li>
                            <li>Kotlin compiler (we'll cover how to install it)</li>
                        </ul>
                        Let's get started!
                    </p>
                    <h5>Step 1: Installing Kotlin compiler</h5>
                    <p>
                        The first step in setting up your Kotlin environment is to install the Kotlin compiler. Here's how to do it on Ubuntu:
                    </p>
                    <p><ul><li>Open the terminal and run the following command:</li></ul></p>
                    <p><pre>curl -s https://get.sdkman.io | bash</pre></p>
                    <p><ul><li>Then, run the following command to load SDKMAN:</li></ul></p>
                    <p><pre>source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"</pre></p>
                    <p><ul><li>Install Kotlin with this command:</li></ul></p>
                    <p><pre>sdk install kotlin</pre></p>
                    <p>That's it! You now have the Kotlin compiler installed on your Linux machine.</p>
                    <h5>Step 2: Setting up a text editor</h5>
                    <p>
                        Now that you have the Kotlin compiler installed, you'll need a text editor to write your Kotlin code. IntelliJ IDEA is a great option for Kotlin development, but you can also use any text editor or IDE that supports Kotlin.
                    </p>
                    <p>To install IntelliJ IDEA, follow these steps:</p>
                    <p><ol>
                        <li>Download the latest version of IntelliJ IDEA from their website <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/">here</a></li>
                        <li>Once the download is complete, open the downloaded file and follow the installation instructions.</li>
                        <li>After the installation is complete, open IntelliJ IDEA and create a new Kotlin project.</li>
                    </ol></p>
                    <p>
                        Congratulations! You now have a Kotlin coding environment set up on your Linux machine.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In the next post of this series, we'll cover Kotlin syntax and basic programming concepts. Stay tuned!
