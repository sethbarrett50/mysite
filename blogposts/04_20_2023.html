                    <p>
                        In the previous post, we showed you how to create a web server using Spring Boot and implement a simple REST API for managing notes. In this post, we'll explore how to use Spring Security to secure your Java web application.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Spring Security is a powerful and highly customizable security framework for Java web applications. It provides a wide range of security features, including authentication, authorization, and encryption.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Step 1: Add Spring Security to Your Project</h5>
                    <p>
                        To add Spring Security to your project, you can add the following dependency to your pom.xml file:
                    </p>
<p><pre><dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
</dependency>
</pre></p>
                    <h5>Step 2: Configure Spring Security</h5>
                    <p>
                        To configure Spring Security, you can create a new class that extends the WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter class and overrides its configure method. In this method, you can define the security rules for your application.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, here's a simple configuration that requires authentication for all requests:
                    </p>
<p><pre>package com.example.notes;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.EnableWebSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter;

@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfiguration extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
    
    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .authorizeRequests()
                .anyRequest().authenticated()
                .and()
            .formLogin()
                .and()
            .logout();
    }
}
</pre></p>
                    <p>
                        This configuration requires authentication for all requests and provides a default login form and logout functionality.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Step 3: Test Your Security Configuration</h5>
                    <p>
                        To test your security configuration, you can try accessing your REST API endpoints without logging in. You should see a "401 Unauthorized" response. After logging in, you should be able to access the endpoints successfully.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Congratulations! You've successfully secured your Java web application using Spring Security. In the next post, we'll explore how to use Hibernate to store and retrieve data from a MySQL database.
                    </p>
