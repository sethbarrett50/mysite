                    <p>
                        In this post, we will explore how to add authentication and authorization to your web application using ASP.NET Core Identity.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Step 1: Understanding ASP.NET Core Identity</h5>
                    <p>
                        ASP.NET Core Identity is a membership system that allows you to add authentication and authorization to your web applications. It provides a set of libraries and tools for managing user authentication, roles, and permissions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some of the key features of ASP.NET Core Identity include:
                    </p>
                    <p><ul>
                        <li>User Registration and Management: You can register new users and manage user accounts, including password resets and account lockouts.</li>
                        <li>Authentication: You can authenticate users using a variety of methods, such as cookies, tokens, or external providers like Google or Facebook.</li>
                        <li>Authorization: You can define roles and permissions for your application and control access to specific areas or features.</li>
                        <li>Two-Factor Authentication: You can enable two-factor authentication for added security.</li>
                        <li>Social Login: You can allow users to sign in with their social media accounts.</li>
                    </ul></p>
                    <p>Step 2: Adding Authentication and Authorization to Your Web Application</p>
                    <p>
                        To add authentication and authorization to your web application using ASP.NET Core Identity, follow these steps:
                    </p>
                    <p><ul>
                        <li>Install the ASP.NET Core Identity package. In Visual Studio, right-click on your project and select "Manage NuGet Packages". Search for "Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity" and install the package.</li>
                        <li>Update your DbContext. Open your DbContext file and add the following code:</li>
                    </ul></p>
<p><pre>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

public class ApplicationDbContext : IdentityDbContext
{
    public ApplicationDbContext(DbContextOptions&lt;ApplicationDbContext&gt; options)
        : base(options)
    {
    }
}</pre></p>         
                    <p><ul>
                        <li>Configure ASP.NET Core Identity. In the "Startup.cs" file, add the following code to the "ConfigureServices" method:</li>
                    </ul></p>
<p><pre>services.AddDbContext&lt;ApplicationDbContext&gt;(options =&gt;
    options.UseSqlServer(Configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection")));

services.AddIdentity&lt;IdentityUser, IdentityRole&gt;()
    .AddEntityFrameworkStores&lt;ApplicationDbContext&gt;()
    .AddDefaultTokenProviders();

services.Configure&lt;IdentityOptions&gt;(options =&gt;
{
    // Password settings
    options.Password.RequireDigit = true;
    options.Password.RequireLowercase = true;
    options.Password.RequireNonAlphanumeric = true;
    options.Password.RequireUppercase = true;
    options.Password.RequiredLength = 8;
    options.Password.RequiredUniqueChars = 1;

    // Lockout settings
    options.Lockout.DefaultLockoutTimeSpan = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(30);
    options.Lockout.MaxFailedAccessAttempts = 5;
    options.Lockout.AllowedForNewUsers = true;

    // User settings
    options.User.AllowedUserNameCharacters =
        "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789-._@+";
    options.User.RequireUniqueEmail = true;

    // SignIn settings
    options.SignIn.RequireConfirmedEmail = false;
    options.SignIn.RequireConfirmedPhoneNumber = false;
});
</pre></p>
                        <p><ul>
                        <li>Add authentication middleware. In the "Startup.cs" file, add the following code to the "Configure" method:</li>
                        </ul></p>
                        <p><pre>app.UseAuthentication();</pre></p>
                        <p><ul>
                        <li>Add authorization middleware. In the "Startup.cs" file, add the following code to the "Configure" method:</li>
                        </ul></p>
                        <p><pre>app.UseAuthorization();</pre></p>
                        <p><ul>
                        <li>Create a user. You can create a user using the UserManager class. For example, to create a new user, you can add the following code to your controller:</li>
                        </ul></p>
<p><pre>var user = new IdentityUser { UserName = "testuser", Email = "testuser@example.com" };
    var result = await _userManager.CreateAsync(user, "P@ssw0rd");</pre></p>
                        <p><ul>
                        <li>Protect a route. To protect a route, you can add the [Authorize] attribute to your controller or action method. For example:</li>
                    </ul></p>
<p><pre>[Authorize]
public IActionResult Secret()
{
    return View();
}</pre></p>
                    <p>Congratulations! You have successfully added authentication and authorization to your web application using ASP.NET Core Identity and C#.</p>
