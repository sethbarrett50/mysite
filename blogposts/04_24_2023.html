                    <div class='title'>Getting Started with Angular on Linux: Setting up Your Coding Environment</div>

                    <p>
                        Angular is a popular web application framework for building dynamic and responsive single-page applications. It's based on TypeScript and uses a component-based architecture, which makes it easy to develop and maintain complex web applications. In this tutorial, we'll go through the steps to set up your coding environment for Angular on Linux.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before we get started, ensure that you have the following software installed on your Linux machine:
                    </p>
                    <p><ul>
                        <li>Node.js and npm</li>
                        <li>Angular CLI</li>
                    </ul></p>
                    <p>
                        You can install Node.js and npm from your distribution's software repository or by downloading them from the official Node.js website. Once you have installed Node.js and npm, run the following command in your terminal to install the Angular CLI:
                    </p>
                    <p><pre>npm install -g @angular/cli</pre></p>
                    <p>
                        Once you have Angular CLI installed, you can create a new Angular project by running the following command:
                    </p>
                    <p><pre>ng new my-app</pre></p>
                    <p>
                        This will create a new Angular project with the name "my-app" in your current directory. You can navigate to the project directory by running the following command:
                    </p>
                    <p><pre>cd my-app</pre></p>
                    <p>
                        Now that you're inside your project directory, you can start a development server and preview your application by running the following command:
                    </p>
                    <p><pre>ng serve --open</pre></p>
                    <p>
                        This will start a local development server and automatically open your application in a web browser. Any changes you make to your code will be automatically reloaded in the browser.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That's it! You're now ready to start building your Angular application. In the next tutorial, we'll dive deeper into the Angular architecture and explore how to create components and services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In conclusion, setting up your coding environment for Angular on Linux is easy and straightforward. With Node.js, npm, and Angular CLI installed, you can create new Angular projects and start developing your web applications right away.
                    </p>
