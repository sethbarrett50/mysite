                    <p>
                        Welcome to the first post of our DevOps series, where we'll explore the powerful combination of Jenkins, Docker, and Artifactory to streamline your software development process. In this post, we'll focus on setting up the necessary tools on a Linux system to get started.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before we dive in, let's quickly recap what each of these tools does:
                    </p>
                    <p><ul>
                        <li>Jenkins is an open-source automation server that helps automate parts of the software development process, such as building, testing, and deploying code.</li>
                        <li>Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to package an application and its dependencies into a single container that can be run on any system.</li>
                        <li>Artifactory is a binary repository manager that allows you to store, manage, and distribute binary artifacts, such as JAR files, Docker images, and more.</li>
                    </ul></p>
                    <p>
                        Now that we know what each of these tools does, let's get started with setting them up on your Linux system.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Step 1: Installing Jenkins</h5>
                    <p>
                        Jenkins can be installed on a Linux system using the package manager of your choice, such as apt or yum. The exact command will depend on your Linux distribution. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install Jenkins using the following command:
                    </p>
<p><pre>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins</pre></p>
                    <p>
                        Once Jenkins is installed, you can access it by visiting <a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a> in your web browser.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Step 2: Installing Docker</h5>
                    <p>
                        Docker can also be installed on a Linux system using the package manager of your choice. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install Docker using the following command:
                    </p>
<p><pre>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker.io</pre></p>
                    <p>
                        Once Docker is installed, you can verify that it is working correctly by running the following command:
                    </p>
                    <p><pre>sudo docker run hello-world</pre></p>
                    <p>
                        This will download a Docker image and run a container based on that image.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Step 3: Installing Artifactory</h5>
                    <p>
                        Artifactory can be downloaded from the JFrog website. The exact installation process will depend on the version of Artifactory you are using and your Linux distribution. Refer to the Artifactory documentation for detailed installation instructions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once Artifactory is installed, you can access it by visiting <a href="http://localhost:8081">http://localhost:8081</a> in your web browser.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With all three tools installed, you're ready to start using them together to streamline your software development process. In the next post in this series, we'll explore how to set up a Jenkins pipeline to build and test a Docker container and publish it to Artifactory. Stay tuned!
                    </p>
