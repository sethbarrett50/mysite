                    <p>
                        Welcome back to our Advanced Machine Learning series! In this blog post, we'll dive into the captivating world of Reinforcement Learning with Function Approximation, where we combine the strengths of RL and function approximation techniques to tackle complex decision-making tasks.
                    </p>
                    <h5>The Challenge of Complex Decision-Making</h5>
                    <p>
                        In many real-world scenarios, decision-making tasks involve large state and action spaces, making it impractical to represent them with explicit tabular methods. Function Approximation allows us to overcome this challenge by representing value functions or policies with parameterized functions.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Value Function Approximation</h5>
                    <p>
                        Value Function Approximation aims to estimate the value function, which maps states to their expected cumulative rewards. Instead of storing values for all possible states, we use a parameterized function (e.g., a neural network) to approximate the value function.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Deep Q-Learning</h5>
                    <p>
                        Deep Q-Learning is a popular algorithm that combines Q-Learning with function approximation using deep neural networks. The Deep Q-Network (DQN) approximates the Q-value function for each state-action pair, enabling RL agents to handle high-dimensional state spaces.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Experience Replay and Target Networks</h5>
                    <p>
                        To stabilize the training process, DQN uses experience replay and target networks. Experience replay stores transitions from past experiences, and during training, random batches of transitions are used for learning. Target networks help mitigate the problem of moving targets by keeping a separate network with fixed parameters for estimating Q-values during training.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Applications of Reinforcement Learning with Function Approximation</h5>
                    <p>
                        Reinforcement Learning with Function Approximation finds applications in various domains, including:
                        <ul>

using Flux: onehotbatch, mse

# Define the Deep Q-Network (DQN) architecture
function dqn_model(input_dim, output_dim)
    return Chain(

# Initialize the DQN model
dqn = dqn_model(input_dim, output_dim)

# Define the loss function
function dqn_loss(state, action, reward, next_state, done)
    target = reward + (1 - done) * γ * maximum(dqn(next_state))
    q_value = dqn(state)[action]
    return mse(q_value, target)
end

# Train the DQN model using Q-Learning and function approximation
function train_dqn(env, episodes, batch_size, γ, ε)
    # Initialize DQN model and optimizer
    dqn = dqn_model(env.observation_space_dim, env.action_space_dim)
    opt = ADAM(0.001)

    for episode in 1:episodes
        state = env.reset()
        done = false

        while !done
            # Choose action using epsilon-greedy policy
            if rand() &lt; ε
                action = rand(1:env.action_space_dim)
            else
                q_values = dqn(state)
                action = argmax(q_values)
            end

            # Perform action in the environment
            next_state, reward, done = env.step(action)

            # Update the DQN model using Q-Learning with function approximation
            loss = dqn_loss(state, action, reward, next_state, done)
            Flux.back!(loss)
            Flux.update!(opt, dqn)

            state = next_state
        end
    end
end</pre></p>
