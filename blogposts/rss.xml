	<description><div class="blog"> <h4>  Jan 17th, 2022 </h4> <div class="title">  Implementing Linked Lists in Python </div> <img alt="Python11" height="445" src="photos/01_17_23.webp" width="250"/> <p>  Hello fellow Python enthusiasts! </p> <p>  In this post, we will be covering some more advanced topics in Python and diving into the world of linked lists. </p> <p>  But first, let's start with a quick refresher on what a linked list is.                         A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object, linked together using pointers.                         Each element, or node, in a linked list consists of two fields: a data field to store the element, and a next field to store the reference to the next node in the list. </p> <p>  There are two types of linked lists: singly linked lists and doubly linked lists.                         In a singly linked list, each node has a reference to the next node in the list, but not the previous one.                         In a doubly linked list, each node has a reference to both the next and previous nodes. </p> <p>  A singly linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object, linked together using pointers.                         Each element, or node, in a singly linked list consists of two fields: a data field to store the element, and a next field to store the reference to the next node in the list.                         The nodes are linked in a sequential manner, such that the next field of each node points to the next node in the list. </p> <p>  Singly linked lists are useful for a variety of applications, such as: </p> <p>  <ul>   <li>    Implementing stacks, which are data structures that support last-in, first-out (LIFO) semantics.   </li>   <li>    Implementing queues, which are data structures that support first-in, first-out (FIFO) semantics.   </li>   <li>    Storing and manipulating data in a linear fashion, such as a list of items.   </li>   <li>    Performing searches and insertions/deletions on a list of items, as these operations can be performed in O(n) time on a singly linked list.   </li>  </ul> </p> <p>  Singly linked lists have some advantages over other data structures, such as arrays.                         For example, they do not require contiguous blocks of memory, so they can be more flexible in terms of memory usage.                         They also allow for efficient insertions and deletions at the head of the list, as no elements need to be shifted around in memory. </p> <p>  However, singly linked lists have some disadvantages as well.                         They do not allow for efficient insertions and deletions at the tail of the list, as the last element does not have a reference to the element preceding it.                         They also do not allow for efficient access to the elements in the middle of the list, as the list must be traversed sequentially from the head to find a specific element. </p> <p>  Now that we have a basic understanding of linked lists, let's see how we can implement them in Python. </p> <p>  We can start by creating a Node class to represent each node in the linked list.                         The Node class will have two instance variables: data to store the element, and next to store the reference to the next node. </p> <p>  <pre>class Node:def __init__(self, data=None):    self.data = data    self.next = None</pre> </p> <p>  Next, we can create a LinkedList class to represent the linked list itself.                         This class will have a head instance variable to keep track of the first node in the list. </p> <p>  <pre>class LinkedList:def __init__(self):    self.head = None</pre> </p> <p>  We can then add various methods to the LinkedList class to manipulate the list.                         For example, we can add a method to add a new node to the list, a method to remove a node from the list, and a method to find a specific node in the list. </p> <p>  <pre>class LinkedList:    def __init__(self):        self.head = None        def add_node(self, data):        new_node = Node(data)        new_node.next = self.head        self.head = new_node        def remove_node(self, data):        current_node = self.head        previous_node = None        while current_node:            if current_node.data == data:                if previous_node:                    previous_node.next = current_node.next                else:                    self.head = current_node.next                return            previous_node = current_node            current_node = current_node.next        def find_node(self, data):        current_node = self.head        while current_node:            if current_node.data == data:                return current_node            current_node = current_node.next        return None</pre> </p> <p>  That's it!                         We now have a basic implementation of a singly linked list in Python. </p> <p>  I hope this has been a helpful introduction to linked lists in Python.                         As always, feel free to leave any comments or questions below. </p> <p>  Happy coding! </p> <!-- Desc: In this blog post, we will cover the basics of linked lists and how to implement them in Python.

	<description><div class="blog"> <h4>  Jan 16th, 2022 </h4> <div class="title">  Exploring the Collections Module in Python: deques, Counters, OrderedDicts, and defaultdicts </div> <img alt="Python11" height="445" src="photos/1_16_23.webp" width="250"/> <p>  Hello and welcome back to my intro to Python series!                         In the previous posts, we learned about advanced concepts such as exception handling, object-oriented programming, inheritance, polymorphism, web scraping with  <code>   requests  </code>  and  <code>   Beautiful Soup  </code>  , and browser automation with  <code>   Selenium  </code>  .                         In this post, we're going to cover a quick overview of the  <code>   collections  </code>  module and some of the specialized data types it provides, and will be diving deeper into each type of collection in future posts. </p> <h5>  Collections Overview </h5> <p>  The  <code>   collections  </code>  module is a built-in Python library that provides additional data types for storing and manipulating data. These data types are specialized versions of the basic data types (such as lists, tuples, and dictionaries) that provide additional functionality and efficiency. Some of the data types in the  <code>   collections  </code>  module are: </p> <p>  <ul>   <li>    <code>     deque    </code>    : A double-ended queue that supports efficient insertion and deletion at both ends.   </li>   <li>    <code>     Counter    </code>    : A dictionary subclass for counting occurrences of hashable objects.   </li>   <li>    <code>     OrderedDict    </code>    : A dictionary subclass that remembers the order that keys were added.   </li>   <li>    <code>     defaultdict    </code>    : A dictionary subclass that provides a default value for missing keys.   </li>  </ul> </p> <p>  Here are some examples of how to use these data types: </p> <p>  <pre>from collections import deque, Counter, OrderedDict, defaultdict# deque exampleq = deque(["a", "b", "c"])q.appendleft("d")  # add an element to the left sideprint(q)  # deque(['d', 'a', 'b', 'c'])q.pop()  # remove and return an element from the right sideprint(q)  # deque(['d', 'a', 'b'])# Counter examplec = Counter(["a", "b", "c", "a", "b", "b"])print(c)  # Counter({'b': 3, 'a': 2, 'c': 1})# OrderedDict exampled = OrderedDict()d["a"] = 1d["b"] = 2d["c"] = 3print(d)  # OrderedDict([('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)])# defaultdict exampledd = defaultdict(int)  # default value is 0dd["a"] = 1dd["b"] = 2print(dd["c"])  # 0</pre> </p> <h5>  Deque </h5> <p>  The deque (short for double-ended queue) is a data structure that is similar to a list, but it allows efficient insertion and deletion at both ends of the sequence.                         It is implemented as a doubly-linked list, which makes it more efficient than a list for these operations.                         Deques are a thread-safe, memory efficient, and flexible data type that can be used in a variety of situations where a list may be used.                         An example of using a deque is as follows: </p> <p>  <pre>from collections import deque# Create a dequed = deque([1, 2, 3])# Add elements to the dequed.appendleft(0)  # add element to the left sided.append(4)  # add element to the right side# Remove elements from the dequed.popleft()  # remove and return element from the left sided.pop()  # remove and return element from the right side# Iterate over the elements of the dequefor x in d:    print(x) </pre> </p> <h5>  Counter </h5> <p>  The Counter is a dictionary subclass from the  <code>   collections  </code>  module that is used for counting occurrences of hashable objects.                         It takes an iterable as input and creates a dictionary with keys for each unique element in the input, and values for the number of occurrences of each element.                         The Counter data type is useful for counting the frequency of elements in a list or other iterable.                         An example of using a Counter is as follows: </p> <p>  <pre>from collections import Counter# Count the frequency of elements in a listc = Counter(["a", "b", "c", "a", "b", "b"])print(c)  # Counter({'b': 3, 'a': 2, 'c': 1})# Convert the Counter to a dictionaryd = dict(c)print(d)  # {'a': 2, 'b': 3, 'c': 1}# Use the most_common method to get the most frequent elementsprint(c.most_common(2))  # [('b', 3), ('a', 2)]# Use arithmetic operations to add or subtract countsc2 = Counter({"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3})c3 = c + c2  # add countsc4 = c - c2  # subtract countsprint(c3)  # Counter({'b': 5, 'a': 3, 'c': 4})print(c4)  # Counter({'b': 1, 'a': 1, 'c': -2})</pre> </p> <p>  This code creates a Counter from the  <code>   list ["a", "b", "c", "a", "b", "b"]  </code>  , which counts 2 occurrences of "a", 3 occurrences of "b", and 1 occurrence of "c".                         It then converts the Counter to a dictionary, gets the 2 most common elements using the  <code>   most_common  </code>  method, and performs arithmetic operations on the Counter to add or subtract counts.                         The output of this code would be  <code>   Counter({'b': 5, 'a': 3, 'c': 4})  </code>  for c3 and  <code>   Counter({'b': 1, 'a': 1, 'c': -2})  </code>  for c4. </p> <h5>  OrderedDict </h5> <p>  The OrderedDict is a dictionary subclass from the  <code>   collections  </code>  module that remembers the order that keys were added to the dictionary.                         It is implemented as a doubly-linked list and preserves the order of keys as they are inserted.                         This can be useful for preserving the order of items in a dictionary, or for creating dictionaries with a specific order for the keys.                         An example of using an OrderedDict is as follows: </p> <p>  <pre>from collections import OrderedDict# Create an OrderedDictd = OrderedDict()# Add elements to the OrderedDictd["a"] = 1d["b"] = 2d["c"] = 3# Iterate over the elements of the OrderedDictfor k, v in d.items():    print(k, v)# Output the elements in the order they were addedprint(d)  # OrderedDict([('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)])</pre> </p> <p>  This code creates an OrderedDict and adds the elements "a" with value 1, "b" with value 2, and "c" with value 3.                         It then iterates over the elements of the OrderedDict and prints the keys and values.                         Finally, it outputs the OrderedDict and shows that the elements are in the order they were added.                         The output of this code would be "a 1", "b 2", "c 3", and  <code>   OrderedDict([('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)])  </code>  . </p> <h5>  defaultdict </h5> <p>  The defaultdict is a dictionary subclass from the  <code>   collections  </code>  module that provides a default value for missing keys.                         It is similar to a regular dictionary, but it allows you to specify a default factory function that is called to provide a default value for a missing key.                        This can be useful for creating dictionaries with default values for missing keys, or for creating dictionaries with keys that have a default behavior.                         An example of using a defaultdict is as follows: </p> <p>  <pre>from collections import defaultdict# Create a defaultdict with a default value of 0dd = defaultdict(int)# Add elements to the defaultdictdd["a"] = 1dd["b"] = 2# Access a missing keyprint(dd["c"])  # 0# Use a default factory function to provide a default valuedef default_factory():    return "default value"dd2 = defaultdict(default_factory)# Access a missing keyprint(dd2["c"])  # "default value" </pre> </p> <p>  This code creates a defaultdict with a default value of 0, and adds the elements "a" with value 1 and "b" with value 2.                         It then accesses a missing key "c" and prints the default value of 0.                         It then creates a defaultdict with a default factory function that returns the string "default value", and accesses a missing key "c" to print the default value.                         The output of this code would be "0" and "default value". </p> <h5>  Conclusion </h5> <p>  The  <code>   collections  </code>  module provides a variety of specialized data types that can be useful in different situations.                         They can provide additional functionality and efficiency compared to the basic data types. </p> <p>  I hope this post has introduced you to the  <code>   collections  </code>  module and its specialized data types in Python.                         In the next post, we'll look at some more advanced topics in Python.                         Thanks for reading! </p> <!-- Desc:  In this blog post, we'll be taking a look at the collections module in Python, a built-in library that provides additional data types for storing and manipulating data.

In the previous posts, we learned about advanced concepts such as exception handling, object-oriented programming, inheritance, polymorphism, and web scraping with  <code>   requests  </code>  and  <code>   Beautiful Soup  </code>  .                         In this post, we're going to look at a library for browser automation:  <code>   Selenium  </code>  . </p> <p>  <code>   Selenium  </code>  is a library for automating web browser actions.                         It allows you to programmatically control a web browser (such as Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) and perform actions such as navigating to websites, filling out forms, clicking buttons, and extracting data.                         This can be useful for tasks such as web scraping, testing, and automating repetitive actions. </p> <p>  To use  <code>   Selenium  </code>  , you need to install the library and also install a web driver for the browser you want to use.                         For example, to use Chrome, you need to install the  <code>   chromedriver  </code>  executable.                         Then, you can use the  <code>   webdriver  </code>  module to control the browser: </p> <p>  <pre>from selenium import webdriverfrom selenium.webdriverQ.common.by import Byfrom selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWaitfrom selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as ECdriver = webdriver.Chrome()  # start Chromedriver.get("http://www.example.com")  # navigate to a websitesub_btn = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(    EC.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, "submit_button")))sub_btn.click()driver.close()  # close the browser</pre> </p> <p>  Selenium provides a rich API for interacting with web elements such as buttons, links, and forms.                        ou can use methods such as EC.presence_of_element_located() inside a  <code>   WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(...)  </code>  code block to wait for an element to load, then locate the element on the webpage and perform actions on them.                         Elements can be located with their  <code>   ID  </code>  ,  <code>   CLASS_NAME  </code>  ,  <code>   CSS_SELECTOR  </code>  ,  <code>   LINK_TEXT  </code>  ,  <code>   NAME  </code>  ,  <code>   PARTIAL_LINK_NAME  </code>  ,  <code>   TAG_NAME  </code>  or  <code>   XPATH  </code>  .                        For example: </p> <p>  <pre>from selenium import webdriverfrom selenium.webdriverQ.common.by import Byfrom selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWaitfrom selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as ECdriver = webdriver.Chrome()driver.get("http://www.example.com")# Fill out a formname_box = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(    EC.presence_of_element_located((By.XPATH,"//*[@id='name']")))name_box.send_keys("John Smith")email_box = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(    EC.presence_of_element_located((By.XPATH,"//*[@id='email']")))email_box.send_keys("jon@example.com")sub_btn = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(    EC.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, "submit_button")))sub_btn.click()# Extract data from the webpagename  = driver.find_element(By.ID, "name").get_attribute("value")print(name)  # prints "John Smith"driver.close() </pre> </p> <p>  <code>   Selenium  </code>  is a powerful library for automating web browser actions, and it can be a useful tool for tasks such as web scraping, testing, and automation.                         However, it can be slower than other libraries because it runs in a real web browser and loads all the web page resources. </p> <p>  I hope this post has introduced you to the  <code>   Selenium  </code>  library for browser automation in Python.                         In the next post, we'll look at some more advanced topics in Python.

	<description><div class="blog"> <h4>  Jan 14th, 2022 </h4> <div class="title">  Exploring Web Scraping and Parsing with requests and Beautiful Soup in Python </div> <img alt="Python8" height="445" src="photos/1_14_23.webp" width="250"/> <p>  Hello and welcome back to my intro to Python series!                         In the previous posts, we learned about advanced concepts such as exception handling, object-oriented programming, inheritance, and polymorphism.                         These are powerful tools that allow you to write more organized and reusable code, and they are an important part of any Python programmer's toolkit.                         In this post, we're going to look at two popular libraries for web scraping and parsing:  <code>   requests  </code>  and  <code>   Beautiful Soup  </code>  . </p> <p>  Web scraping is a technique for extracting data from websites, and it is a useful tool for a wide range of tasks, such as data mining, data analytics, and even automating tasks.                         In Python, you can use the requests library to make HTTP requests to websites and retrieve the HTML or other data that they return.                         The Beautiful Soup library is a popular library for parsing and navigating HTML and XML data, which makes it easy to extract the data that you need from a website. </p> <p>  I am currently using both  <code>   requests  </code>  and  <code>   Beautiful Soup  </code>  for my Vault research project, where I am web scraping 3rd party Android app stores to keep an updated list of all available apps.                         I am also using these libraries for my IoT research project, where I am web scraping IoT device manufacturing sites to keep an updated list of all manufactured IoT devices.                         Both of these projects require me to retrieve and parse data from multiple websites, and the combination of  <code>   requests  </code>  and  <code>   Beautiful Soup  </code>  makes it easy to do so efficiently and effectively.                         We'll be learning more about how to use these libraries in Python in this post. </p> <p>  <code>   requests  </code>  is a library for making HTTP requests in Python.                         It allows you to send HTTP requests (such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to a web server and receive a response.                         For example: </p> <p>  <pre>import requestsresponse = requests.get("http://www.example.com")print(response.status_code)  # prints 200 if the request is successfulprint(response.text)  # prints the HTML content of the webpage </pre> </p> <p>  <code>   Beautiful Soup  </code>  is a library for parsing HTML and XML documents. It allows you to extract data from a webpage in a more convenient and efficient way than manually parsing the HTML. For example: </p> <p>  <pre>from bs4 import BeautifulSouphtml = """&lt;html&gt;    &lt;head&gt;        &lt;title&gt;My webpage&lt;/title&gt;    &lt;/head&gt;    &lt;body&gt;    &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;    &lt;p&gt;This is my webpage&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;"""soup = BeautifulSoup(html, "html.parser")title = soup.find("title").stringprint(title)  # prints "My webpage" </pre> </p> <p>  You can use  <code>   requests  </code>  and  <code>   Beautiful Soup  </code>  together to scrape data from a webpage.                         For example: </p> <p>  <pre>import requestsfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoupurl = "http://www.example.com"response = requests.get(url)soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")# Extract data from the webpage using Beautiful Souptitle = soup.find("title").stringparagraphs = soup.find_all("p")# Print the extracted dataprint(title)for p in paragraphs:    print(p.string) </pre> </p> <p>  <code>   requests  </code>  and  <code>   Beautiful Soup  </code>  are just two of the many libraries available for web scraping and parsing in Python.                         They are widely used and well-documented, making them a good choice for beginners. </p> <p>  I hope this post has introduced you to the  <code>   requests  </code>  and  <code>   Beautiful Soup  </code>  libraries in Python.                         In the next post, we'll look at some more advanced topics in Python.                         Thanks for reading! </p> <!-- Desc: In this post, we'll learn about using the requests and Beautiful Soup libraries in Python for web scraping and parsing.

	<description><div class="blog"> <h4>  Jan 13th, 2022 </h4> <div class="title">  Understanding Inheritance and Polymorphism in Python </div> <img alt="Python8" height="445" src="photos/1_13_23.webp" width="250"/> <p>  Hello and welcome back to my intro to Python series!                         In the previous post, we learned about exception handling and object-oriented programming in Python.                         These are powerful tools that allow you to write more organized and reusable code, and they are an important part of any Python programmer's toolkit.                         In this post, we're going to cover two more advanced OOP concepts: inheritance and polymorphism. </p> <p>  Inheritance is a way to create a new class that is a modified version of an existing class.                         The new class is called the subclass, and the existing class is the superclass.                         The subclass inherits attributes and behavior from the superclass, and can also have additional attributes and behavior of its own.                         This allows you to create a hierarchy of classes, where a subclass can inherit attributes and behavior from its superclass, and then further customize or override those attributes and behavior as needed.                         This is a powerful way to reuse code and avoid redundancy, as you can create a base class with common attributes and behavior, and then create subclasses that inherit from that base class and specialize it for specific purposes.                         For example: </p> <p>  <pre>class Animal:    def __init__(self, name, species):        self.name = name        self.species = species        def make_sound(self):        print("Some generic animal sound")class Cat(Animal):    def __init__(self, name, breed, toy):        super().__init__(name, species="Cat")  # call superclass's __init__ method        self.breed = breed        self.toy = toy        def play(self):        print(f"{self.name} plays with {self.toy}")cat1 = Cat("Kitty", "Siamese", "String")print(cat1.name)  # prints "Kitty"print(cat1.species)  # prints "Cat"cat1.make_sound()  # prints "Some generic animal sound"cat1.play()  # prints "Kitty plays with String" </pre> </p> <p>  In this example, we create a  <code>   Cat  </code>  subclass that inherits from the  <cat>   Animal  </cat>  superclass.                         The  <code>   Cat  </code>  class has its own  <code>   __init__  </code>  method and a  <code>   play  </code>  method, but it also has access to the attributes and  <code>   make_sound  </code>  method of the  <code>   Animal  </code>  class. </p> <p>  Polymorphism is the ability of a subclass to override or extend the behavior of its superclass.                         For example: </p> <p>  <pre>class Animal:    def __init__(self, name, species):        self.name = name        self.species = species        def make_sound(self):        print("Some generic animal sound")class Cat(Animal):    def __init__(self, name, breed, toy):        super().__init__(name, species="Cat")        self.breed = breed        self.toy = toy        def make_sound(self):        print("Meow")class Dog(Animal):    def __init__(self, name, breed):        super().__init__(name, species="Dog")        self.breed = breed        def make_sound(self):        print("Woof")animals = [Cat("Kitty", "Siamese", "String"), Dog("Fido", "Labrador")]for animal in animals:    animal.make_sound() </pre> </p> <p>  In this example, we have a  <code>   Cat  </code>  and a  <code>   Dog  </code>  class that both inherit from the  <code>   Animal  </code>  class.                         However, each subclass has its own implementation of the  <code>   make_sound  </code>  method, which overrides the one in the superclass.                         When we call the  <code>   make_sound  </code>  method on each animal in the list, it calls the correct method for each type of animal.                         This is an example of polymorphism: the same method (  <code>   make_sound  </code>  ) behaves differently for different objects (  <code>   Cat  </code>  and  <code>   Dog  </code>  ). </p> <p>  Inheritance and polymorphism are powerful tools in object-oriented programming that allow you to create flexible and reusable code.                         They can make your code more organized and easier to maintain. </p> <p>  I hope this post has helped you understand inheritance and polymorphism in Python.                         In the next post, we'll look at some more advanced topics in Python, such as modules and packages.

    <title>Advanced Topics in Python: Exception Handling and Object-Oriented Programming</title>

	<description><div class="blog"> <h4>  Jan 12th, 2022 </h4> <div class="title">  Advanced Topics in Python: Exception Handling and Object-Oriented Programming </div> <img alt="Python7" height="445" src="photos/1_12_23.webp" width="250"/> <p>  Welcome back to our Python3 intro course!                         In the last few lessons, we've covered a range of foundational Python concepts, including variables, data types, loops, conditional statements, functions, modules, and file input and output.                         These are all important concepts to understand as they form the building blocks of any Python program.                         In this lesson, we'll be exploring some more advanced topics, including exception handling and object-oriented programming. </p> <p>  Exception handling is a technique for handling runtime errors in your code.                         When an error occurs, Python raises an exception, which can be caught and handled using the  <code>   try  </code>  and  <code>   except  </code>  statements.                         This allows you to gracefully handle errors in your program, rather than having it crash or produce unexpected results.                         For example, you might use exception handling to validate user input, to handle network errors when making web requests, or to handle cases where a file is not found.                         Exception handling is an important tool to have in your programming toolkit, as it helps you to write more robust and reliable code.                        For example: </p> <p>  <pre>try:    x = 5 / 0except ZeroDivisionError:    print("Cannot divide by zero")</pre> </p> <p>  This code will raise a  <code>   ZeroDivisionError  </code>  exception when it attempts to divide 5 by 0, but the exception will be caught and the message "Cannot divide by zero" will be printed instead of the error. </p> <p>  Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code that operates on that data.                         In Python, we can create classes to define our own objects.                         For example: </p> <p>  <pre>class Dog:    def __init__(self, name, breed):        self.name = name        self.breed = breed        def bark(self):        print("Woof!")dog1 = Dog("Fido", "Labrador")print(dog1.name)  # prints "Fido"dog1.bark()  # prints "Woof!" </pre> </p> <p>  In this example, we define a  <code>   Dog  </code>  class with a  <code>   __init__  </code>  method (a special method in Python that is called when an object is created) and a  <code>   bark  </code>  method.                         We then create a  <code>   dog1  </code>  object of type  <code>   Dog  </code>  and call its methods. </p> <p>  I hope this gives you a good introduction to exception handling and object-oriented programming in Python.                         In the next post, we'll dive even deeper into these topics and learn about inheritance and polymorphism.

	<description><div class="blog"> <h4>  Jan 11th, 2022 </h4> <div class="title">  File Input and Output in Python: An Introduction </div> <img alt="Python6" height="445" src="photos/1_11_23.webp" width="250"/> <p>  Welcome back to our Python3 intro course!                         In the last lesson, we learned about using modules and libraries in Python.                         In this lesson, we'll be exploring how to work with file input and output in Python. </p> <p>  One of the most useful features of programming languages is the ability to read data from and write data to files.                         This allows you to store and retrieve data on a permanent basis, rather than just while your program is running.                        I find myself using this feature all the time, and the  <code>   with  </code>  function we will cover can also be used for various other functions, like automatically closing a socket either after a transmission is ended or if the connections drops.                        This lesson should greatly help with your understanding of these concepts. </p> <p>  In Python, you can read and write files using the built-in  <code>   open()  </code>  function and the  <code>   read()  </code>  ,  <code>   readline()  </code>  ,  <code>   write()  </code>  , and  <code>   close()  </code>  methods of file objects.                         For example: </p> <p>  <pre># Open a file for writingf = open("test.txt", "w")# Write some text to the filef.write("Hello, World!")# Close the filef.close() </pre> </p> <p>  This creates a new file called "test.txt" and writes the string "Hello, World!" to it. </p> <p>  You can also open a file for reading using the "r" mode, like this: </p> <p>  <pre># Open a file for readingf = open("test.txt", "r")# Read the contents of the filecontents = f.read()# Print the contentsprint(contents)  # Output: Hello, World!# Close the filef.close() </pre> </p> <p>  You can use the  <code>   readline()  </code>  method to read a single line of the file at a time, or you can use a  <code>   for  </code>  &gt; loop to iterate over the lines of the file.                         For example: </p> <p>  <pre># Open a file for readingf = open("test.txt", "r")# Read and print each line of the filefor line in f:    print(line)# Close the filef.close() </pre> </p> <p>  It's important to close your files when you're done with them to free up system resources.                         You can use the  <code>   with  </code>  statement to automatically close a file when you're done with it.                         For example: </p> <p>  <pre># Open a file for readingwith open("test.txt", "r") as f:    # Read and print each line of the file    for line in f:        print(line)</pre> </p> <p>  This will automatically close the file when the  <code>   with  </code>  block ends. </p> <p>  I hope this has been a helpful introduction to file input and output in Python.                         These concepts will be essential as you continue to learn and work with Python, so be sure to practice and get comfortable with them.                         In the next lesson, we'll be exploring more advanced topics such as exception handling and object-oriented programming.                         Stay tuned! </p> <!-- Desc: This blogpost will cover how to work with file input and output in Python.

	<description><div class="blog"> <h4>  Jan 10th, 2022 </h4> <div class="title">  Using Modules and Libraries in Python: An Introduction </div> <img alt="Python5" height="445" src="photos/1_10_23.webp" width="250"/> <p>  Welcome back to our Python3 intro course!                         In the last lesson, we learned about using functions in Python.                         In this lesson, we'll be exploring how to work with modules and libraries in Python. </p> <p>  Modules are a vital part of Python programming, and they allow for the organization and reuse of code.                         By creating a module, you can write a set of functions, classes, and variables that can be easily imported and used in other Python scripts.                         This helps to keep your code clean and organized, and it also makes it easier to share your code with others.                         There are many community-created modules available for Python, which greatly expand its functionality and make it a powerful language for a wide range of tasks.                         For example, there are modules specifically designed for data science, machine learning, web development, and even penetration testing.                         Without these open source modules, Python would not be nearly as effective for these tasks. </p> <p>  You can use modules in your code by using the  <code>   import  </code>  keyword, followed by the module name.                         For example: </p> <p>  <pre>import mathprint(math.pi)  # Output: 3.141592653589793print(math.cos(math.pi))  # Output: -1.0 </pre> </p> <p>  This imports the  <code>   math  </code>  module and allows you to access its functions and variables, such as  <code>   pi  </code>  and  <code>   cos  </code>  . </p> <p>  You can also import specific functions or variables from a module using the  <code>   from  </code>  keyword.                         For example: </p> <p>  <pre>import mathprint(math.pi)  # Output: 3.141592653589793print(math.cos(math.pi))  # Output: -1.0 </pre> </p> <p>  This imports the  <code>   pi  </code>  and  <code>   cos  </code>  functions from the  <code>   math  </code>  module and allows you to use them directly in your code </p> <p>  Libraries are collections of modules that provide a wide range of functionality for a particular task or set of tasks.                         Some popular Python libraries include  <code>   numpy  </code>  for numerical computing,  <code>   pandas  </code>  for data manipulation and analysis, and  <code>   matplotlib  </code>  for data visualization.                         You can install libraries using the  <code>   pip  </code>  package manager, which is included with Python.                         For example: </p> <p>  <pre>pip install numpy </pre> </p> <p>  This installs the  <code>   numpy  </code>  library, which you can then use in your code by importing it like any other module. </p> <p>  I hope this has been a helpful introduction to using modules and libraries in Python.                         These concepts will be essential as you continue to learn and work with Python, so be sure to practice and get comfortable with them.

	<description><div class="blog"> <h4>  Jan 9th, 2022 </h4> <div class="title">  Using Functions in Python: An Introduction </div> <img alt="Python4" height="445" src="photos/1_9_23.webp" width="250"/> <p>  Welcome back to our Python3 intro course!                         In the last lesson, we learned about working with iteration and conditional statements in Python.                         These are important concepts to understand as they allow us to create more complex programs that can make decisions and perform actions based on certain conditions.                         In this lesson, we'll be exploring and learning how to define and call functions in Python, as well as how to work with input parameters and return values. By the end of this lesson, you should have a solid understanding of how to use functions in Python. </p> <p>  Functions are a way to group together a set of related instructions and give them a name, which can then be called upon when needed.                        Functions can also accept input parameters, which allows us to customize their behavior and make them more versatile.                         Functions are a cornerstone of programming and they allow you to break up your code into smaller, more manageable chunks.                         This makes it easier to write, read, and understand your code, and it also makes it easier to reuse your code in different parts of your program.                         Functions are defined using the  <code>   def  </code>  keyword in Python, followed by the function name and a set of parentheses.                         Inside the parentheses, you can specify any parameters or arguments that the function needs in order to run.                         For example, you might define a function like this: </p> <p>  <pre>def greet():    print("Hello, World!") </pre> </p> <p>  This creates a function called  <code>   greet  </code>  that simply prints "Hello, World!".                         You can call a function by simply typing its name followed by a set of parentheses.                         For example: </p> <p>  <pre>greet()  # Output: Hello, World! </pre> </p> <p>  You can also pass arguments to a function, which are values that the function can use to perform its task.                         For example: </p> <p>  <pre>def greet(name):    print("Hello, " + name + "!")greet("Alice")  # Output: Hello, Alice!greet("Bob")  # Output: Hello, Bob! </pre> </p> <p>  In this example, the  <code>   greet  </code>  function takes a single argument,  <code>   name  </code>  , and prints a personalized greeting using the value of  <code>   name  </code>  . </p> <p>  You can also define default values for function arguments, which will be used if no value is provided when the function is called.                         For example: </p> <p>  <pre>def greet(name="World"):    print("Hello, " + name + "!")greet()  # Output: Hello, World!greet("Alice") # Output: Hello, Alice!greet("Bob")  # Output: Hello, Bob! </pre> </p> <p>  In this example, the default value of  <code>   name  </code>  is "World", so if no value is provided when the function is called, it will use this default value. </p> <p>  Functions can also return values using the  <code>   return  </code>  keyword. For example: </p> <p>  <pre>def add(x, y):    return x + yresult = add(5, 6)  # result is now 11 </pre> </p> <p>  In this example, the add function takes two arguments,  <code>   x  </code>  and  <code>   y  </code>  , and returns their sum. </p> <p>  I hope this has been a helpful introduction to using functions in Python.                         Functions are an essential tool for organizing and simplifying your code, so be sure to practice and get comfortable with them.                         In the next lesson, we'll be exploring how to work with modules and libraries in Python. Stay tuned! </p> <!-- Desc: This next blog post will cover how to use functions in Python. Functions are blocks of code that perform specific tasks and can be called by their name. They can take arguments, have default values for arguments, and return values. Functions are useful for organizing and reusing code. This blog post will provide examples and explanations of how to define and use functions in Python.

	<description><div class="blog"> <h4>  Jan 8th, 2022 </h4> <div class="title">  Loops and Conditional Statements in Python: An Introduction </div> <img alt="Python3" height="445" src="photos/1_8_23.webp" width="250"/> <p>  Welcome back to our Python3 intro course!                         In the last lesson, we learned about variables and data types in Python.                         These are fundamental concepts in programming that allow us to store and manipulate data in our programs.                         In this lesson, we'll be looking at more advanced concepts, including lists, loops and conditional statements.                         These are powerful tools that allow us to perform complex operations on our data and make our programs more dynamic. </p> <p>  Lists are an essential data structure in Python, allowing you to store and organize data in an ordered sequence.                         You can create a list by enclosing a comma-separated sequence of values in square brackets.                         Lists can contain elements of any data type, including other lists, making them a very flexible data structure.                         You can access the elements of a list using their index, which is the position of the element in the list.                         You can also modify the elements of a list by assigning new values to them using their index.                         Lists also have a number of built-in methods that allow you to perform various operations on them, such as adding or removing elements, sorting the list, and more.                         We'll be learning more about lists and how to work with them in Python in this lesson.                        For example: </p> <p>  <pre>fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'mango'] </pre> </p> <p>  This creates a list of three fruit strings.                         We'll use them for iteration more in this blog post, but will cover them more in depth in our post about data structures. </p> <p>  Loops allow you to execute a block of code multiple times, either a set number of times or until a certain condition is met.                         There are two types of loops in Python:  <code>   for  </code>  loops and  <code>   while  </code>  loops. </p> <p>  A  <code>   for  </code>  loop is used to iterate over a sequence, such as a list or a string. For example: </p> <p>  <pre>fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'mango']for fruit in fruits:    print(fruit) </pre> </p> <p>  This will print each fruit in the  <code>   fruits  </code>  list on a separate line. </p> <p>  A  <code>   while  </code>  loop, on the other hand, will execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is  <code>   True  </code>  .                         For example: </p> <p>  <pre>i = 1while i &lt; 6:    print(i)    i += 1 </pre> </p> <p>  This will print the numbers 1 through 5 on separate lines. </p> <p>  Conditional statements, also known as  <code>   if  </code>  statements, allow you to execute a block of code only if a certain condition is met.                         For example: </p> <p>  <pre>x = 10if x &gt; 5:    print("x is greater than 5") </pre> </p> <p>  This will print "x is greater than 5" because the condition  <code>   x &gt; 5  </code>  is  <code>   True  </code>  . </p> <p>  You can also use  <code>   elif  </code>  statements to check for multiple conditions, and an  <code>   else  </code>  statement to specify a block of code to be executed if none of the conditions are met.                         For example: </p> <p>  <pre>x = 10if x &gt; 15:    print("x is greater than 15")elif x &gt; 5:    print("x is greater than 5 but less than or equal to 15")else:    print("x is less than or equal to 5") </pre> </p> <p>  This will print "x is greater than 5 but less than or equal to 15" because  <code>   x  </code>  is greater than 5 but not greater than 15. </p> <p>  I hope this has been a helpful introduction to loops and conditional statements in Python.                         These concepts will be essential as you continue to learn and work with Python, so be sure to practice and get comfortable with them.                         In the next lesson, we'll be looking at functions, which allow you to organize and reuse your code.                         Stay tuned! </p> <!-- Desc: The next blog post is a continuation of a Python3 introduction course. It will cover more advanced concepts including lists, loops and conditional statements.

In the last lesson, we covered how to set up your Python environment and create your first Python program.                         In this lesson, we'll delve deeper into using variables and data types in Python. </p> <p>  A variable is a named container for storing data.                         In Python, you can create a variable by simply assigning a value to it using the assignment operator `=`.                         For example: </p> <p>  <pre>                        x = 5                        y = "hello"                    </pre>  <p>   Here, we've created two variables: `x`, which contains the integer value 5, and `y`, which contains the string "hello".  </p>  <p>   Python has several built-in data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and Booleans.  </p>  <p>   An integer is a whole number, either positive or negative.                         For example:  </p>  <p>   <pre>                        x = 5                        y = -10                    </pre>  </p>  <p>   A floating-point number is a number with a decimal point.                         For example:  </p>  <p>   <pre>                        x = 3.14                        y = -2.718                    </pre>  </p>  <p>   A string is a sequence of characters, either letters, numbers, or symbols, enclosed in either single or double quotation marks.                         For example:  </p>  <p>   <pre>                        x = "hello"                        y = '12345'                    </pre>  </p>  <p>   A Boolean is a data type that can have only two values: `True` or `False`.                         For example:  </p>  <p>   <pre>                        x = True                        y = False                    </pre>  </p>  <p>   You can also use the `type()` function to check the data type of a variable.                         For example:  </p>  <p>   <pre>                        x = 5                        print(type(x))                          # Output: &lt;class 'int'&gt;                        y = "hello"                        print(type(y))                         # Output: &lt;class 'str'&gt;                    </pre>  </p>  <p>   It's important to use the appropriate data type for your variables, as this can affect how your program behaves.                         For example, if you try to perform arithmetic operations on a string, you'll get an error.  </p>  <p>   <pre>                        x = "hello"                        y = 5                        print(x + y)                          # Output: TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str                    </pre>  </p>  <p>   To avoid this, you can use type conversion functions to convert variables to the desired data type.                         For example:  </p>  <p>   <pre>                        x = "5"                        y = int(x)                          # y is now the integer 5                        x = 5                        y = str(x)                          # y is now the string "5"                    </pre>  </p>  <p>   I hope this has been a helpful introduction to using variables and data types in Python.

	<description><div class="blog"> <h4>  Jan 6th, 2022 </h4> <div class="title">  Getting Started with Python: Setting up Your Environment </div> <img alt="Python1" height="445" src="photos/1_6_23.webp" width="250"/> <p>  Welcome to my new Python3 intro course!                         Python is a fantastic language to learn for beginners, as it's very versatile, has a comprehensive standard library with a wide range of downloadable modules, a user-friendly syntax, and has a wide range of applications.                         From system administrators using the standard library, to data scientists using pandas and numpy, to machine learning engineers using TensorFlow, to web developers using Django, to first-time coders, Python might be the perfect language for you to learn. </p> <p>  In this first lesson, we will cover setting up your Python environment so that it works from the command line. </p> <p>  To get started, you'll need to make sure you have Python3 downloaded on your machine.                         If you're using macOS, you should already have it installed, but you can also download the latest version from python.org.                         On Linux, you can download Python3 via your package manager (e.g. `sudo apt install Python3` on Debian).                         On Windows, you can download Python3 from the official website and make sure to click the option to add Python to your system PATH. </p> <p>  Once you have Python3 installed, you'll want to ensure it's up and running properly.                         Open up your terminal or command line and type     <code>    python3   </code>    .                         You should see a response like this:     <code>    &gt;&gt;&gt;   </code>    This is called the Python REPL (read-evaluate-print loop), which allows you to enter lines of Python code and have them evaluated.                         This is useful for testing your code or doing quick calculations on your computer.                         If you encounter any errors when running your code, try going through it line by line in the REPL to identify the cause. </p> <p>  Next, you'll need to choose a text editor to use for writing your code.                         There are many options available, including vim, neovim, Notepad, Sublime, Notepad++, and Emacs.                         In this course, we'll be using Visual Studio Code (VSC).                         To set up VSC for Python, create a new directory to hold your Python files and open it in VSC as your project.                         Then, download the Python and Pylance extensions from Microsoft from the extensions tab on the right.                         These tools will provide syntax highlighting, easier debugging, static type checking, and code formatting, which are all helpful for anyone starting out with Python. </p> <p>  Now that you have your environment set up, let's create our first Python program.                         In the Explorer tab on the left, click the new file button and name it `hello.py`.                         Inside this file, type     <code>    print("Hello World!")   </code>    .                         The `print()` function writes the text inside the parentheses (called the "parameter") to the console.                         In this case, the parameter is a string (a series of characters enclosed in quotation marks). </p> <p>  To run your program, you can use the terminal in VSC by clicking the terminal tab at the top and then clicking the new terminal button.                         This will open a terminal window at the bottom of the screen, inside the directory you created and opened earlier.                         Type     <code>    python3 hello.py   </code>    and hit enter to run the program, and "Hello World" should appear.                         Congratulations, you've created and run your first Python program! </p> <p>  In the next lesson, we'll cover basic data types and variables in Python, and we'll create a slightly larger program that includes reading input from the user.                         I hope you found this lesson helpful! </p> <!-- Desc: In this tutorial, we'll walk through the steps to set up your Python environment so you can start writing and running Python programs. We'll cover installing Python, using the REPL, and setting up Visual Studio Code as a text editor. Let's get started! --></div></description>

	<description><div class="blog"> <h4>  Jan 5th, 2022 </h4> <div class="title">  Improving the Security of My Nginx Webserver </div> <img alt="Update RSS Script" height="445" src="photos/1_5_23.webp" width="250"/> <h5>  Web Server Security Test </h5> <p>  In my personal, professional blog, I wanted to make sure that my nginx webserver was secure.                         To do this, I ran a security test from  <a href="https://www.immuniweb.com/websec/">   immuniweb, found here.  </a>  I found several vulnerabilities that needed to be improved upon, including issues with my website's GDPR compliance, PCI DSS compliance, and HTTP headers security. </p> <h5>  GDPR Compliance Test </h5> <p>  To fix the GDPR compliance issues, I added a privacy policy html page and inserted it into the footers of all my pages.                         I also made sure to outline that we do not collect personally identifiable information or use cookies. </p> <h5>  PCI DSS Compliance Test </h5> <p>  In the PCI DSS Compliance Test, it was noted that my website's CMS could not be reliably fingerprinted and that I should make sure it is up to date.                         Additionally, it was recommended that I implement a web application firewall (WAF) to protect against common web attacks. </p> <p>  Although my website does not use a web-based content management system, I am currently using UFW as a firewall.                         However, I am planning on setting up a VLAN with an openBSD server to act as my WAF in order to further improve the security of my website.                         Ensuring that my website is compliant with PCI DSS standards and has a strong firewall is an important step in protecting it against potential threats. </p> <h5>  HTTP Headers Security Test </h5> <p>  In the HTTP Headers Security Test, it was recommended that I implement strict-transport-security, X-Frame-Options, and X-Content-Type-Options to improve the security of my website. </p> <p>  To fix strict-transport-security, I added the following code to my nginx config located at `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` to enable STS for HTTP: </p> <p>  <pre>                        add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000;                        includeSubDomains" always;                         location / { root /usr/share/nginx/html; }                         location /servlet {                             add_header X-Served-By "My Servlet Handler";                             add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;                             proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;                         }                    </pre> </p> <p>  This included adding a header for strict-transport-security to the `location` block in my config and redeclaring it in a second `location` block. </p> <p>  To fix the X-Frame-Option, I added the following code to `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default` to hide the header:     <code>    proxy_hide_header X-Frame-Options;   </code>   </p> <p>  To fix X-Content-Type-Options, I added the following code for X-Content-Type-Options to my nginx config located at `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` with a value of "nosniff":     <code>    add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff";   </code>   </p> <p>  Enabling these HTTP headers helps to protect my website and its users against potential threats and improve overall security. </p> <h5>  Content Security Policy Test </h5> <p>  In the Content Security Policy Test, it was noted that the CONTENT-SECURITY-POLICY and CONTENT-SECURITY-POLICY-REPORT-ONLY headers were not being sent by the server. </p> <p>  To fix this issue, I added the following code to `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` to enable the Content Security Policy (CSP) for my website:     <code>    add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self';" always;   </code>   </p> <p>  Implementing a CSP helps to protect my website and its users from potential threats by defining a set of rules for the browser to follow when loading resources.                         This helps to prevent malicious attacks such as cross-site scripting and clickjacking.                         Ensuring that my website has a strong CSP is an important step in improving its overall security. </p> <p>  In this blog post, I discussed the steps I took to improve the security of my nginx webserver.                         This included fixing vulnerabilities related to GDPR compliance, PCI DSS compliance, HTTP headers security, and Content Security Policy.                         By taking these steps, I was able to better protect my website and its users against potential threats and improve its overall security.                         It is important for all website owners to take steps to ensure the security of their websites and protect their users. </p> <!-- Desc: In this blog post, I discuss the steps taken to improve the security of an nginx webserver.

    <title>Automating RSS Feed Updates with Shell and Python</title>
	<link>https://sethbarrett.xyz/blogposts/1_4_2023.html</link>
	<pubDate>Wed, 04 Jan 2023 09:49:45 +400</pubDate>

	<description><div class="blog"> <h4>  Jan 4th, 2022 </h4> <div class="title">  Automating RSS Feed Updates with Shell and Python </div> <img alt="Update RSS Script" height="445" src="photos/updateRSS.webp" width="250"/> <p>  If you run a blog or website, it's important to keep your readers informed of new content by providing an RSS feed. But manually updating the feed can be a tedious process.                         In this post, I'll show you how to automate the process using a combination of shell and Python scripts. </p> <h5>  Setting up the RSS Feed </h5> <p>  First, I create the RSS feed itself.                         I based my feed on the formatting described in this tutorial:  <a href="https://rss.com/blog/how-to-create-an-rss-feed/">   How to Create an RSS Feed.  </a> </p> <p>  I then created an `rss.xml` file in my blogposts directory and formatted it according to the tutorial.                         Then, I got to work on automating the input of blog post details. </p> <h5>  Automating the Process </h5> <p>  I started by writing a shell script that calls a Python script and passes the first argument (the name of an HTML file for a blog post) to the script: </p> <p>  <pre>                        #!/bin/bash                        python3 /Users/SEBARRETT/Code/updateRss.py "$1"                    </pre> </p> <p>  Next, I wrote a Python script that does the following: </p> <ul>  <li>   Takes the name of an HTML file for a blog post as an argument  </li>  <li>   Uses Beautiful Soup to parse the HTML file and extract the `div` element with the class "blog"  </li>  <li>   Returns the title and contents of the blog post  </li>  <li>   Inserts the title and contents into the `rss.xml` file as a new `item` element, below the `atom` element and above all the other `item` elements  </li> </ul> <p>  The complete Python script can be found  <a href="https://github.com/sethbarrett50/update_RSS_Feed">   here:  </a> </p> <!-- <p><pre>                        import sys                        import re                        import datetime                        from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as bs4                        # Takes the html document, uses bs4 to get div element with class blog                        def getBlogContents() -> tuple[str]:                            with open(f'/Users/SEBARRETT/Code/mysite/blogposts/{sys.argv[1]}', 'r') as f:                                soup = bs4(f.read(), 'html.parser')                            title = soup.find('div', class_='title').text                            contents = re.sub('\n', '', soup.find('div', class_='blog').prettify())                            return (title, contents)                        # Adds blog contents to top of channel as a new item                        def addToRss(bc: str) -> None:                            RSS_PATH = "/Users/SEBARRETT/Code/mysite/blogposts/rss.xml"                            with open(RSS_PATH, 'r') as rss_file:                                rss_xml = rss_file.read()                            START_LINE = '<atom:link href="https://sethbarrett.xyz/rss.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/>'                            channel_start_index = rss_xml.index(START_LINE)                            now = datetime.datetime.now()                            rss_xml = (rss_xml[:channel_start_index+len(START_LINE)] +                                f'\n  <item>\n    <title>{bc[0]}</title>\n\t<link>https://sethbarrett.xyz/blogposts/{sys.argv[1]}</link>\n\t<pubDate>{now.strftime("%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %z")}+400</pubDate>\n\t<guid>https://sethbarrett.xyz/blogposts/{sys.argv[1]}/</guid>\n\t<description>{bc[1]}</description>\n  </item>' +                                rss_xml[channel_start_index+len(START_LINE):])                        with open(RSS_PATH, 'w') as rss_file:                            rss_file.write(rss_xml)                    def main() -> None:                        blogContents = getBlogContents()                        addToRss(blogContents)                    if __name__ == "__main__":                        main()                    </pre></p> --> <p>  To parse the HTML document, the script uses Beautiful Soup to extract the `div` element with the class "blog" and its contents.                        I had experience using BS4 from my previous work on my Vault research project, so this was a breeze.                        The extracted title and contents are then inserted into the `rss.xml` file as a new `item` element, below the `atom` element and above all the other `item` elements.                         The `item` element includes the title of the post, a link to the post, the publication date using the `datetime` library, and the main contents of the post.                         After testing the script, it was successfully able to update the `rss.xml` file with the new blog post information. </p> <p>  To make the shell script executable, the command `chmod +x updateRSS.sh` was used.                         An alias for the script was also added to the `zsh` configuration file. </p> <p>  In the future, I plan to have the script automatically detect when a new blog post has been added using `git add` and `grep`, and then run the script automatically to update the RSS feed. </p> <p>  If you'd like to follow our RSS feed, the URL is `sethbarrett.xyz/blogposts/rss.xml`. </p> <!-- Desc: This blog post discusses how to automate the process of updating an RSS feed for a blog or website using shell and Python scripts.

	<description><div class="blog"> <h4>  Jan 3rd, 2022 </h4> <div class="title">  My Experience Setting Up and Using Diffusion Bee: AI Image Creating Software </div> <img alt="Stable Diffusion 1" height="445" src="photos/stableDiff.webp" width="250"/> <p>  Hey everyone! </p> <p>  I wanted to share with you my experience today with setting up and using Diffusion Bee, an AI image creating software.                         I used it on my MacBook Pro, which has a M1 Max chip and 64Gb of ram.                         I figured that should be enough to run the software smoothly and create high quality AI art. </p> <p>  I used the DiffusionBee UI for this, and I have to say it was a fairly easy process.                         You can find the github page  <a href="https://github.com/divamgupta/diffusionbee-stable-diffusion-ui">   here  </a>  and the main website  <a href="https://diffusionbee.com/">   here  </a>  . </p> <p>  The setup process was straightforward, though it did take a bit of time.                         First, I had to download the dmg file from the main website and add it to my applications folder.                         There are two versions of DiffusionBee available for Apple Silicon chips, and I opted for the high quality version since my MacBook Pro has good specs.                         The initial dmg file was only 500Mb, but once you start up the application, 8 models need to be downloaded, so make sure you have at least 8Gb of free space and some time to allow the models to download. </p> <p>  DiffusionBee has several different modes of use, including text to image, image to image, in-painting and out-painting. Here's a breakdown of each mode: </p> <ul>  <li>   Text to image generates an image based on an input string  </li>  <div class="exPic">   <figure>    <img alt="Text to Image" height="445" src="photos/sdI2I.webp" width="250"/>    <figcaption>     Image created from the text prompt "create an image representing IoT security, Cel Shading"    </figcaption>   </figure>  </div>  <li>   Image to image modifies an image provided based on an input string  </li>  <div class="exPic">   <figure>    <img alt="Image to Image1" height="445" src="photos/alexa1.webp" width="250"/>    <img alt="Image to Image2" height="445" src="photos/alexa2.webp" width="250"/>    <figcaption>     Image on right created from left image and text prompt "draw in cell shade style"    </figcaption>   </figure>  </div>  <li>   In-painting removes or adds objects to a region of a provided image based on an input string  </li>  <div class="exPic">   <figure>    <img alt="In-Painting1" height="445" src="photos/ip1.webp" width="250"/>    <img alt="In-Painting2" height="445" src="photos/ip2.webp" width="250"/>    <figcaption>     Image on right created from left image and text prompt "add a smartphone" with the white area colored in    </figcaption>   </figure>  </div>  <li>   Out-painting expands an image outward using an input string  </li>  <div class="exPic">   <figure>    <img alt="Out-Painting1" height="445" src="photos/op1.webp" width="250"/>    <img alt="Out-Painting2" height="445" src="photos/op2.webp" width="250"/>    <figcaption>     Image on right created from left image and text prompt "draw more mountains"    </figcaption>   </figure>  </div>  <!-- <li>                            Upscaling increases the resolution of a provided image                        </li> --> </ul> <p>  One of the main reasons I really like DiffusionBee is that it runs entirely locally on my machine without communicating with any cloud services. Plus, its search system allows advanced control over the machine learning program. If you're looking for a way to run stable diffusion and you have a MacBook Pro that meets the minimum specs, I highly recommend checking out DiffusionBee! </p> <!-- Desc: In this blog post, I share my experience setting up and using Diffusion Bee, an AI image creating software that runs entirely locally on my MacBook Pro.

	<description><div class="blog"> <h4>  Jan 2nd, 2022 </h4> <div class="title">  RegEx101: An Essential Tool for Generating and Understanding Regular Expressions </div> <img alt="Regular Expressions 101" height="445" src="photos/reg.webp" width="250"/> <p>  Hello everyone, </p> <p>  I wanted to share with you a tool that I have found extremely helpful in my work as a programmer and system administrator.  <a href="https://regex101.com/">   That tool is RegEx101, an online resource that helps me generate regular expressions for a variety of programming languages and use cases, found here.  </a> </p> <p>  For those who may not be familiar, regular expressions (also known as "regex" or "regexp") are a powerful way to search and manipulate text.                         They are used in many programming languages and are an essential skill for anyone working with data or text processing. </p> <p>  RegEx101 is an excellent resource for anyone looking to create or work with regular expressions.                         It supports a wide range of programming languages, including AutoIt, C#, Golang, Java, JavaScript, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Rust, SED, and Swift 5.2.                         Not only can it generate code based on each language's regex syntax, but it also supports various use cases such as matching, substitutions, lists, and unit tests. </p> <p>  I have found RegEx101 to be an invaluable resource in my projects, including my research on Vault and IoT device security.                         It has helped me create complex regular expressions that are over 200 characters in length, and the SED generator has even been useful for grep and awk in my server maintenance work. </p> <p>  In addition to its code generation capabilities, RegEx101 also includes a quick reference guide that explains the different parts of a regex language, such as tokens, anchors, meta sequences, quantifiers, character classes, flags, and modifiers.                         This has helped me better understand the different components of a regex and how they work together. </p> <p>  One of my favorite features of RegEx101 is its ability to test a regex against a sample string.                         This allows me to see exactly how my regex is matching the string and which groups are being captured.                         It also provides a detailed explanation of each character and sequence in the regex, making it a great learning tool as well. </p> <p>  In short, RegEx101 is an essential resource for anyone working with regular expressions, whether you're a seasoned programmer or just starting out.                         I highly recommend giving it a try if you're looking to improve your regex skills or just need a quick and easy way to generate regex code. </p> <p>  Thanks for reading, and I hope this has been helpful! </p> <!-- Desc: In this blog post, I'll be sharing how I use the website RegEx101 to help me generate regular expressions. From supporting multiple programming languages to offering a quick reference guide and the ability to test your regular expressions against a test string, RegEx101 has become an invaluable resource for me in both my programming and system administration work. If you're looking to improve your skills with regular expressions, I highly recommend giving RegEx101 a try. --></div></description>

	<description><div class="blog"> <h4>  December 31st, 2022 </h4> <div class="title">  Improving Server Security: Tips and Techniques for Hardening Your Server </div> <img alt="Harden Server" height="445" src="photos/harden.webp" width="250"/> <p>  As a server administrator, it is important to take measures to ensure the security and stability of the server.                         In my previous blog post, I discussed setting up ssh keys as a secure method of logging into the server.                         In this post, I want to share a few more steps I have taken to harden the server and improve its security. </p> <p>  First, I added a new user to the server using the `adduser` command and included them in the sudo group.                         This allows me to perform privileged tasks without constantly using the root user, which poses a security risk.                         It is generally a best practice to avoid using the root user for everyday tasks, as any mistakes or vulnerabilities present in the actions taken with the root user can have severe consequences for the system. </p> <p>  Next, I copied my ssh key's id to the new user's login and edited the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file to disable both root login and password login.                         This means that ssh keys are the only way to access the server, adding an extra layer of security.                         It is important to make sure to backup your ssh keys to a USB drive or other secure location, as losing access to your keys could prevent you from logging into the server.                         If you are using a hosting provider like Vultr, it is also a good idea to take advantage of any additional security measures they offer, such as the ability to gain access to the server through their website in case you lose your keys. </p> <p>  I also used the Uncomplicated Firewall (ufw), which is included as a package by default with Vultr, to close all ports on the server except for those used for HTTP, HTTPS, and SSH.                         This helps to reduce the attack surface of the server and prevent unauthorized access. </p> <p>  Lastly, I made a small but important change to the Nginx configuration located at `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` by uncommenting the `server_tokens off` setting.                         By default, Nginx displays its version number on error pages, but this setting disables that behavior.                         While it may not seem like a significant change, hiding the version number can make it more difficult for attackers to target known vulnerabilities in specific versions of Nginx. </p> <p>  As I continue to work with the server, I am sure I will take additional steps to harden it and improve its security.                         I will be sure to keep you all updated on my progress. </p> <!-- Desc: In this blog post, we discuss a variety of steps and techniques that can be taken to improve the security of a server. From adding a new user and disabling root login, to using a firewall and hiding the version number of Nginx, these tips can help to reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect against potential vulnerabilities. Whether you are a server administrator or just looking to improve the security of your own personal server, this post offers valuable insights and guidance. --></div></description>

    <title>Streamlining Website Maintenance with Shell Scripts and Cronjobs</title>
	<link>https://sethbarrett.xyz/blogposts/12_30_2022.html</link>
	<pubDate>Wed, 04 Jan 2023 08:57:07 +400</pubDate>

	<description><div class="blog"> <h4>  December 30th, 2022 </h4> <div class="title">  Streamlining Website Maintenance with Shell Scripts and Cronjobs </div> <img alt="The Bourne-Again Shell" height="445" src="photos/bash.webp" width="250"/> <p>  As we saw in yesterday's post, it's important to keep your website up to date in order to maintain security and ensure that everything is running smoothly.                         One way to automate this process is by using a shell script.                         In this post, we'll go over how to set up a script that will automatically update your website whenever you make changes. </p> <p>  First, you'll need to set up SSH keys for your server.                         This will allow you to securely connect to the server and run commands remotely.                        To do this, you can use the `ssh-keygen` command to generate a new SSH key, and then use `ssh-copy-id` to connect the key to your site's SSH. </p> <p>  Once you have your SSH keys set up, you can create a shell script that takes an argument representing your commit message.                         This script will commit and push any updates to your website's repository, log in to the remote server using the expect command and your new SSH key, change to your website repository location, and pull the update.                         Finally, the script will exit the server. </p> <p>  Here's the shell script in action: </p> <p>  <pre>                            #!/bin/bash                                                        # Run git commit with the -a and -m flags                            #Uses the command line argument as the commit message                            git commit -a -m "$1"                                                        # Push the committed changes to the remote repository                            git push                                                        # Use expect to automate the login process                            expect &lt;&lt;- DONE                              # Wait for the login prompt and send the login command                              spawn ssh root@sethbarrett.xyz                                                          # Wait for the command prompt and send the cd command                              expect "$"                              send "cd /var/www/mysite/\r"                                                          # Wait for the command prompt and send the git pull command                              expect "$"                              send "git pull\r"                                                          # Exit remote server                              expect "$"                              send "exit"                                                            # Exit the expect script                              expect eof                            DONE                        </pre> </p> <p>  With this script in place, you can easily update your website whenever you make changes, without having to log in to the server manually.                         This can save you a lot of time and effort, and ensures that your website is always up to date. </p> <p>  Cronjobs are a powerful tool for automating tasks on a Linux server.                         By using cron, you can schedule a script or command to run at specific intervals, such as every hour, day, week, or month.                         This can be especially useful for tasks that need to be run on a regular basis, such as website updates or backups.                        Yesterday, I used it to set up a cronjob to automatically renew my websites certificate monthly so I don't have to check all the time. </p> <p>  In the future, I plan on utilizing cronjobs to further automate the maintenance and management of my website.                         For example, I could set up a cronjob to run the shell script we discussed above every day at a certain time, to ensure that my website is always up to date.                         I could also set up cronjobs for other tasks, such as cleaning up old log files or sending notifications when certain events occur.                         By using cronjobs, I can save time and effort by automating these tasks, and ensure that my website is always running smoothly. </p> <!-- Desc: In this blog post, we will discuss how to automate the process of updating your website using a shell script. We will go over the steps for setting up SSH keys for your server and creating a shell script that can commit and push updates to your website's repository, log in to the server, and pull the updates. We will also provide an example of the shell script in action.

	<description><div class="blog"> <h4>  December 29th, 2022 </h4> <div class="title">  Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Up Your Own Website: From Domain Name to Secure Server </div> <img alt="epik" height="250" src="photos/epik.webp" width="250"/> <p>  Setting up a website can seem like a daunting task, especially if you're new to the process.                         However, with the right tools and knowledge, it can be a relatively straightforward process. </p> <p>  In this blog post, we'll cover the steps I took to set up my website, including renting a domain name, choosing a server hosting provider, and configuring the server with Nginx. </p> <p>  First, I used a company called epik to rent my domain name.                         The process was fairly quick, taking about a quarter of a day before my domain name was registered to me.                        Its also pretty cool that epik supports cryptocurrency as a payment method. </p> <p>  Next, I chose Vultr as my server hosting provider, opting for a cloud compute Debian general purpose server.                         I chose the cheapest size that still allowed for IPv4, which cost around $5 per month.  <a href="https://www.vultr.com/?ref=9325408">   If you'd like to get $100 credit on Vultr for any of your server needs, use my referall link here when you sign up!  </a> </p> <img alt="Vultr" height="445" src="photos/vultr.webp" width="250"/> <p>  Once I had my server set up, I linked the server's IPv4 and IPv6 addresses with the DNS records on Epik.                         This ensured that my website could be accessed using the domain name I had rented. </p> <p>  I decided to use Nginx as my web server, rather than the more traditional Apache.                         While I was familiar with Apache, I wanted to try something new and found Nginx to be fairly easy to use. </p> <p>  After setting up the website and placing my HTML files in the /var/www/mysite directory, I used Certbot to generate a certificate for my site.                         This ensures that all communication between my website and its users is encrypted and secure. </p> <p>  Finally, I set up a cronjob to automate the process of renewing my certificates, ensuring that my website remains secure over time. </p> <p>  Overall, the process of setting up a website may seem intimidating at first, but with the right tools and knowledge, it can be a relatively straightforward process.                         Whether you're a seasoned pro or a beginner, following these steps can help you get your website up and running in no time. </p> <!-- Desc: In this blog post, learn the steps for setting up a website, including renting a domain name, choosing a server hosting provider, and configuring the server with Nginx.

    <title>Using C# and Regular Expressions for Data Analysis in My Vault Research Project</title>
	<link>https://sethbarrett.xyz/blogposts/12_28_2022.html</link>

	<description><div class="blog"> <h4>  December 28th, 2022 </h4> <div class="title">  Using C# and Regular Expressions for Data Analysis in My Vault Research Project </div> <img alt="C# Regular Expression Language" height="445" src="photos/regEx.webp" width="250"/> <p>  I've recently been using C#'s regular expression language for my Vault research project, specifically for finding Android permissions data and Java encryption and security package imports within the java files of decompiled apks from the aptoide store. </p> <p>  One of the main benefits of using regular expressions is the ability to easily search through large amounts of data and pull out specific patterns or groups of characters.                         In this case, I'm using the regex function to search through all the files within each directory related to each decompiled application and find instances of "java.security." or "javax.crypto.". </p> <p>  To do this, I'm using the following piece of C# code:     <code>    Regex packEx = new Regex(@"(java.security.\w*|javax.crypto.\w*)");   </code>    The use of grouping in this regular expression is essential for finding these specific patterns within the data.                        By using the parentheses, we are able to group together the "java.security." and "javax.crypto." patterns, and the use of the pipe symbol (|) allows us to search for either of these patterns.                         The \w* characters at the end of each group allow for any combination of alphanumeric characters to follow these patterns. </p> <p>  In addition to searching for Java packages, I have also been using regular expressions to find instances of Android permission usage in the files.                         To do this, I am using the following regular expression:     <code>    @"([\w])([^(]{[^{](android.permission.[A-Z_])"   </code>   </p> <p>  This regular expression searches for any instance of "android.permission." followed by one or more capitalized and underscore-separated characters.                         The use of the square brackets, parentheses, and curly braces allows for the search to be specific to the use of Android permissions within the code and to capture the method and class names that the permission usage is found in. </p> <p>  Compiling the regular expression before using it in loops is also an important consideration for efficiency.                         When a regular expression is compiled, it is converted into an optimized form that is faster to execute.                         This is especially important when running the regex function on a large number of files within a loop. </p> <p>  As an undergraduate, I had the opportunity to learn C# with Dr. Dowell, and I have continued to enjoy using this language in my research and professional endeavors.                         In my recent work on the Vault project, I found C#'s regular expression language and the ability to walk through file trees recursively to be particularly useful tools. </p> <p>  While using C# on a Mac has presented some challenges, such as the lack of a fully-featured visual studio edition, I have found that the benefits of using this language far outweigh any difficulties.                         I am grateful for the opportunity to have learned C# during my undergraduate studies, and I continue to enjoy using it in my work. </p> <!-- Desc: Learn how to use C# regular expression language for searching and finding specific patterns within data, including Android permission usage and Java encryption and security package imports.

	<description><div class="blog"> <h4>  December 27th, 2022 </h4> <div class="title">  Progress Report on PhD Research Project: Detecting Vault Apps using Machine Learning </div> <img alt="Aptoide Logo" height="445" src="photos/aptoide.webp" width="250"/> <p>  Hi everyone, </p> <p>  I wanted to give an update on the progress of my PhD research project, which focuses on using                        machine learning to detect vault apps in the Aptoide 3rd party Android app store.                        As some of you may know, I've been working on this project since last March and it will be a                        part of my dissertation. </p> <p>  So far, we have scraped 500 apps from the app store and collected all the text and images from                        the individual sites.                        We have also downloaded any freely available apk files associated with the apps and decompiled                        them into java files.                        Using regular expressions, we are searching for any permissions data or imported packages in the                        files that may suggest that a particular app is a vault app. </p> <p>  The data we gather through this process will be used to train a machine learning program to                        detect these types of apps.                        The vault apps will serve as positive examples, while the non-vault apps will be negative                        examples. </p> <p>  Our goal is to use this research to create a piece of software that can help law enforcement                        locate hidden vault apps on the devices of bad actors, such as foreign agents or drug dealers,                        and determine how the information is stored (e.g. locally on the device, in an accessible cloud                        storage service, or securely encrypted locally on the device). </p> <p>  Overall, the project is progressing well and I'm excited to see the results of our machine                        learning program once it is trained on the data we've collected.                        I'll be sure to keep you updated on any further developments. </p> <p>  Thanks for reading! </p> <!-- Desc: Get an update on my PhD research project using machine learning to detect vault apps in the Aptoide 3rd party Android app store.

Time has flown by as I've immersed myself in my research, learning about new technologies and                        techniques that I never would have even known existed before. </p> <p>  As I look back on these past seven months, I'm amazed at how much I've learned and how much my                        research has grown.                        I've had the opportunity to work with some truly brilliant minds in the field, and have had the                        chance to contribute my own ideas and insights to our work. </p> <p>  One of the most rewarding aspects of this experience has been seeing the tangible results of my                        research.                        Whether it's through the development of a new tool or the identification of a previously unknown                        vulnerability, it's incredibly satisfying to see my work make a real impact. </p> <p>  While the road through academia can be challenging at times, it's also been an incredible                        journey filled with growth and discovery.                        I'm excited to see where the next few years will take me, and I can't wait to see what new                        discoveries and insights I'll uncover along the way. </p> <p>  As I embark on the next phase of my education and career, I am excited to take on a number of                        new challenges and projects.                        Currently, I am working on three research projects that are at the forefront of my focus.                        In addition, I am beginning my PhD classes, which I am eager to dive into and learn as much as                        possible. </p> <p>  I am also taking on the task of learning about setting up and hosting a website and mail server.                        This is a new area for me, and I am excited to add this skill to my toolkit. </p> <p>  Finally, I am committed to continuing my learning journey and expanding my knowledge of                        programming languages, particularly those that are applicable to new use cases and paradigms                        that I have not yet encountered.                        I believe that staying up-to-date on the latest technologies and approaches is essential for                        success in this field, and I am eager to take on this challenge. </p> <p>  Overall, I am excited to see what the future holds and to continue pushing myself to be the best                        that I can be. </p> <!-- Desc: Reflect on seven months of research in digital forensics, machine learning, and cyber security at Augusta University.
