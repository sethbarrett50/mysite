	<description><div class="blog"> <h4>  December 26th, 2022 </h4> <div class="title">  Learning and Growing as a PhD Researcher in Digital Forensics and Computer                        Science </div> <img alt="Wanderer" height="445" src="photos/wanderer.webp" width="250"/> <p>  It's hard to believe that it's already been seven months since I started my my research at                        Augusta University in digital forensics, machine learning, and cyber security.                        Time has flown by as I've immersed myself in my research, learning about new technologies and                        techniques that I never would have even known existed before. </p> <p>  As I look back on these past seven months, I'm amazed at how much I've learned and how much my                        research has grown.                        I've had the opportunity to work with some truly brilliant minds in the field, and have had the                        chance to contribute my own ideas and insights to our work. </p> <p>  One of the most rewarding aspects of this experience has been seeing the tangible results of my                        research.                        Whether it's through the development of a new tool or the identification of a previously unknown                        vulnerability, it's incredibly satisfying to see my work make a real impact. </p> <p>  While the road through academia can be challenging at times, it's also been an incredible                        journey filled with growth and discovery.                        I'm excited to see where the next few years will take me, and I can't wait to see what new                        discoveries and insights I'll uncover along the way. </p> <p>  As I embark on the next phase of my education and career, I am excited to take on a number of                        new challenges and projects.                        Currently, I am working on three research projects that are at the forefront of my focus.                        In addition, I am beginning my PhD classes, which I am eager to dive into and learn as much as                        possible. </p> <p>  I am also taking on the task of learning about setting up and hosting a website and mail server.                        This is a new area for me, and I am excited to add this skill to my toolkit. </p> <p>  Finally, I am committed to continuing my learning journey and expanding my knowledge of                        programming languages, particularly those that are applicable to new use cases and paradigms                        that I have not yet encountered.                        I believe that staying up-to-date on the latest technologies and approaches is essential for                        success in this field, and I am eager to take on this challenge. </p> <p>  Overall, I am excited to see what the future holds and to continue pushing myself to be the best                        that I can be. </p> <!-- Desc: Reflect on seven months of research in digital forensics, machine learning, and cyber security at Augusta University. I have had the opportunity to work with brilliant minds, contribute their own ideas, and see tangible results from their work. I am currently working on three research projects, starting their PhD classes, learning about website and mail server setup, and expanding their knowledge of programming languages. I am excited for the future and committed to continuing their learning journey and staying up-to-date on the latest technologies and approaches. --></div></description>
