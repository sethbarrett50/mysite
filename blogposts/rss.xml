	<description><div class="blog"> <h4>  Jan 3rd, 2022 </h4> <div class="title">  My Experience Setting Up and Using Diffusion Bee: AI Image Creating Software </div> <img alt="Stable Diffusion 1" height="445" src="photos/stableDiff.webp" width="250"/> <p>  Hey everyone! </p> <p>  I wanted to share with you my experience today with setting up and using Diffusion Bee, an AI image creating software.                         I used it on my MacBook Pro, which has a M1 Max chip and 64Gb of ram.                         I figured that should be enough to run the software smoothly and create high quality AI art. </p> <p>  I used the DiffusionBee UI for this, and I have to say it was a fairly easy process.                         You can find the github page  <a href="https://github.com/divamgupta/diffusionbee-stable-diffusion-ui">   here  </a>  and the main website  <a href="https://diffusionbee.com/">   here  </a>  . </p> <p>  The setup process was straightforward, though it did take a bit of time.                         First, I had to download the dmg file from the main website and add it to my applications folder.                         There are two versions of DiffusionBee available for Apple Silicon chips, and I opted for the high quality version since my MacBook Pro has good specs.                         The initial dmg file was only 500Mb, but once you start up the application, 8 models need to be downloaded, so make sure you have at least 8Gb of free space and some time to allow the models to download. </p> <p>  DiffusionBee has several different modes of use, including text to image, image to image, in-painting and out-painting. Here's a breakdown of each mode: </p> <ul>  <li>   Text to image generates an image based on an input string  </li>  <div class="exPic">   <figure>    <img alt="Text to Image" height="445" src="photos/sdI2I.webp" width="250"/>    <figcaption>     Image created from the text prompt "create an image representing IoT security, Cel Shading"    </figcaption>   </figure>  </div>  <li>   Image to image modifies an image provided based on an input string  </li>  <div class="exPic">   <figure>    <img alt="Image to Image1" height="445" src="photos/alexa1.webp" width="250"/>    <img alt="Image to Image2" height="445" src="photos/alexa2.webp" width="250"/>    <figcaption>     Image on right created from left image and text prompt "draw in cell shade style"    </figcaption>   </figure>  </div>  <li>   In-painting removes or adds objects to a region of a provided image based on an input string  </li>  <div class="exPic">   <figure>    <img alt="In-Painting1" height="445" src="photos/ip1.webp" width="250"/>    <img alt="In-Painting2" height="445" src="photos/ip2.webp" width="250"/>    <figcaption>     Image on right created from left image and text prompt "add a smartphone" with the white area colored in    </figcaption>   </figure>  </div>  <li>   Out-painting expands an image outward using an input string  </li>  <div class="exPic">   <figure>    <img alt="Out-Painting1" height="445" src="photos/op1.webp" width="250"/>    <img alt="Out-Painting2" height="445" src="photos/op2.webp" width="250"/>    <figcaption>     Image on right created from left image and text prompt "draw more mountains"    </figcaption>   </figure>  </div>  <!-- <li>                            Upscaling increases the resolution of a provided image                        </li> --> </ul> <p>  One of the main reasons I really like DiffusionBee is that it runs entirely locally on my machine without communicating with any cloud services. Plus, its search system allows advanced control over the machine learning program. If you're looking for a way to run stable diffusion and you have a MacBook Pro that meets the minimum specs, I highly recommend checking out DiffusionBee! </p> <!-- Desc: In this blog post, I share my experience setting up and using Diffusion Bee, an AI image creating software that runs entirely locally on my MacBook Pro.

	<description><div class="blog"> <h4>  Jan 2nd, 2022 </h4> <div class="title">  RegEx101: An Essential Tool for Generating and Understanding Regular Expressions </div> <img alt="Regular Expressions 101" height="445" src="photos/reg.webp" width="250"/> <p>  Hello everyone, </p> <p>  I wanted to share with you a tool that I have found extremely helpful in my work as a programmer and system administrator.  <a href="https://regex101.com/">   That tool is RegEx101, an online resource that helps me generate regular expressions for a variety of programming languages and use cases, found here.  </a> </p> <p>  For those who may not be familiar, regular expressions (also known as "regex" or "regexp") are a powerful way to search and manipulate text.                         They are used in many programming languages and are an essential skill for anyone working with data or text processing. </p> <p>  RegEx101 is an excellent resource for anyone looking to create or work with regular expressions.                         It supports a wide range of programming languages, including AutoIt, C#, Golang, Java, JavaScript, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Rust, SED, and Swift 5.2.                         Not only can it generate code based on each language's regex syntax, but it also supports various use cases such as matching, substitutions, lists, and unit tests. </p> <p>  I have found RegEx101 to be an invaluable resource in my projects, including my research on Vault and IoT device security.                         It has helped me create complex regular expressions that are over 200 characters in length, and the SED generator has even been useful for grep and awk in my server maintenance work. </p> <p>  In addition to its code generation capabilities, RegEx101 also includes a quick reference guide that explains the different parts of a regex language, such as tokens, anchors, meta sequences, quantifiers, character classes, flags, and modifiers.                         This has helped me better understand the different components of a regex and how they work together. </p> <p>  One of my favorite features of RegEx101 is its ability to test a regex against a sample string.                         This allows me to see exactly how my regex is matching the string and which groups are being captured.                         It also provides a detailed explanation of each character and sequence in the regex, making it a great learning tool as well. </p> <p>  In short, RegEx101 is an essential resource for anyone working with regular expressions, whether you're a seasoned programmer or just starting out.                         I highly recommend giving it a try if you're looking to improve your regex skills or just need a quick and easy way to generate regex code. </p> <p>  Thanks for reading, and I hope this has been helpful! </p> <!-- Desc: In this blog post, I'll be sharing how I use the website RegEx101 to help me generate regular expressions.

    <title>Improving Server Security: Tips and Techniques for Hardening Your Server</title>
	<link>https://sethbarrett.xyz/blogposts/12_31_2022.html</link>

	<description><div class="blog"> <h4>  December 31st, 2022 </h4> <div class="title">  Improving Server Security: Tips and Techniques for Hardening Your Server </div> <img alt="Harden Server" height="445" src="photos/harden.webp" width="250"/> <p>  As a server administrator, it is important to take measures to ensure the security and stability of the server.                         In my previous blog post, I discussed setting up ssh keys as a secure method of logging into the server.                         In this post, I want to share a few more steps I have taken to harden the server and improve its security. </p> <p>  First, I added a new user to the server using the `adduser` command and included them in the sudo group.                         This allows me to perform privileged tasks without constantly using the root user, which poses a security risk.                         It is generally a best practice to avoid using the root user for everyday tasks, as any mistakes or vulnerabilities present in the actions taken with the root user can have severe consequences for the system. </p> <p>  Next, I copied my ssh key's id to the new user's login and edited the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file to disable both root login and password login.                         This means that ssh keys are the only way to access the server, adding an extra layer of security.                         It is important to make sure to backup your ssh keys to a USB drive or other secure location, as losing access to your keys could prevent you from logging into the server.                         If you are using a hosting provider like Vultr, it is also a good idea to take advantage of any additional security measures they offer, such as the ability to gain access to the server through their website in case you lose your keys. </p> <p>  I also used the Uncomplicated Firewall (ufw), which is included as a package by default with Vultr, to close all ports on the server except for those used for HTTP, HTTPS, and SSH.                         This helps to reduce the attack surface of the server and prevent unauthorized access. </p> <p>  Lastly, I made a small but important change to the Nginx configuration located at `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` by uncommenting the `server_tokens off` setting.                         By default, Nginx displays its version number on error pages, but this setting disables that behavior.                         While it may not seem like a significant change, hiding the version number can make it more difficult for attackers to target known vulnerabilities in specific versions of Nginx. </p> <p>  As I continue to work with the server, I am sure I will take additional steps to harden it and improve its security.                         I will be sure to keep you all updated on my progress. </p> <!-- Desc: In this blog post, we discuss a variety of steps and techniques that can be taken to improve the security of a server. From adding a new user and disabling root login, to using a firewall and hiding the version number of Nginx, these tips can help to reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect against potential vulnerabilities. Whether you are a server administrator or just looking to improve the security of your own personal server, this post offers valuable insights and guidance. --></div></description>

    <title>Streamlining Website Maintenance with Shell Scripts and Cronjobs</title>
	<link>https://sethbarrett.xyz/blogposts/12_30_2022.html</link>
	<pubDate>Wed, 04 Jan 2023 08:57:07 +400</pubDate>

	<description><div class="blog"> <h4>  December 30th, 2022 </h4> <div class="title">  Streamlining Website Maintenance with Shell Scripts and Cronjobs </div> <img alt="The Bourne-Again Shell" height="445" src="photos/bash.webp" width="250"/> <p>  As we saw in yesterday's post, it's important to keep your website up to date in order to maintain security and ensure that everything is running smoothly.                         One way to automate this process is by using a shell script.                         In this post, we'll go over how to set up a script that will automatically update your website whenever you make changes. </p> <p>  First, you'll need to set up SSH keys for your server.                         This will allow you to securely connect to the server and run commands remotely.                        To do this, you can use the `ssh-keygen` command to generate a new SSH key, and then use `ssh-copy-id` to connect the key to your site's SSH. </p> <p>  Once you have your SSH keys set up, you can create a shell script that takes an argument representing your commit message.                         This script will commit and push any updates to your website's repository, log in to the remote server using the expect command and your new SSH key, change to your website repository location, and pull the update.                         Finally, the script will exit the server. </p> <p>  Here's the shell script in action: </p> <p>  <pre>                            #!/bin/bash                                                        # Run git commit with the -a and -m flags                            #Uses the command line argument as the commit message                            git commit -a -m "$1"                                                        # Push the committed changes to the remote repository                            git push                                                        # Use expect to automate the login process                            expect &lt;&lt;- DONE                              # Wait for the login prompt and send the login command                              spawn ssh root@sethbarrett.xyz                                                          # Wait for the command prompt and send the cd command                              expect "$"                              send "cd /var/www/mysite/\r"                                                          # Wait for the command prompt and send the git pull command                              expect "$"                              send "git pull\r"                                                          # Exit remote server                              expect "$"                              send "exit"                                                            # Exit the expect script                              expect eof                            DONE                        </pre> </p> <p>  With this script in place, you can easily update your website whenever you make changes, without having to log in to the server manually.                         This can save you a lot of time and effort, and ensures that your website is always up to date. </p> <p>  Cronjobs are a powerful tool for automating tasks on a Linux server.                         By using cron, you can schedule a script or command to run at specific intervals, such as every hour, day, week, or month.                         This can be especially useful for tasks that need to be run on a regular basis, such as website updates or backups.                        Yesterday, I used it to set up a cronjob to automatically renew my websites certificate monthly so I don't have to check all the time. </p> <p>  In the future, I plan on utilizing cronjobs to further automate the maintenance and management of my website.                         For example, I could set up a cronjob to run the shell script we discussed above every day at a certain time, to ensure that my website is always up to date.                         I could also set up cronjobs for other tasks, such as cleaning up old log files or sending notifications when certain events occur.                         By using cronjobs, I can save time and effort by automating these tasks, and ensure that my website is always running smoothly. </p> <!-- Desc: In this blog post, we will discuss how to automate the process of updating your website using a shell script.

	<description><div class="blog"> <h4>  December 29th, 2022 </h4> <div class="title">  Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Up Your Own Website: From Domain Name to Secure Server </div> <img alt="epik" height="250" src="photos/epik.webp" width="250"/> <p>  Setting up a website can seem like a daunting task, especially if you're new to the process.                         However, with the right tools and knowledge, it can be a relatively straightforward process. </p> <p>  In this blog post, we'll cover the steps I took to set up my website, including renting a domain name, choosing a server hosting provider, and configuring the server with Nginx. </p> <p>  First, I used a company called epik to rent my domain name.                         The process was fairly quick, taking about a quarter of a day before my domain name was registered to me.                        Its also pretty cool that epik supports cryptocurrency as a payment method. </p> <p>  Next, I chose Vultr as my server hosting provider, opting for a cloud compute Debian general purpose server.                         I chose the cheapest size that still allowed for IPv4, which cost around $5 per month.  <a href="https://www.vultr.com/?ref=9325408">   If you'd like to get $100 credit on Vultr for any of your server needs, use my referall link here when you sign up!  </a> </p> <img alt="Vultr" height="445" src="photos/vultr.webp" width="250"/> <p>  Once I had my server set up, I linked the server's IPv4 and IPv6 addresses with the DNS records on Epik.                         This ensured that my website could be accessed using the domain name I had rented. </p> <p>  I decided to use Nginx as my web server, rather than the more traditional Apache.                         While I was familiar with Apache, I wanted to try something new and found Nginx to be fairly easy to use. </p> <p>  After setting up the website and placing my HTML files in the /var/www/mysite directory, I used Certbot to generate a certificate for my site.                         This ensures that all communication between my website and its users is encrypted and secure. </p> <p>  Finally, I set up a cronjob to automate the process of renewing my certificates, ensuring that my website remains secure over time. </p> <p>  Overall, the process of setting up a website may seem intimidating at first, but with the right tools and knowledge, it can be a relatively straightforward process.                         Whether you're a seasoned pro or a beginner, following these steps can help you get your website up and running in no time. </p> <!-- Desc: In this blog post, learn the steps for setting up a website, including renting a domain name, choosing a server hosting provider, and configuring the server with Nginx.

	<description><div class="blog"> <h4>  December 28th, 2022 </h4> <div class="title">  Using C# and Regular Expressions for Data Analysis in My Vault Research Project </div> <img alt="C# Regular Expression Language" height="445" src="photos/regEx.webp" width="250"/> <p>  I've recently been using C#'s regular expression language for my Vault research project, specifically for finding Android permissions data and Java encryption and security package imports within the java files of decompiled apks from the aptoide store. </p> <p>  One of the main benefits of using regular expressions is the ability to easily search through large amounts of data and pull out specific patterns or groups of characters.                         In this case, I'm using the regex function to search through all the files within each directory related to each decompiled application and find instances of "java.security." or "javax.crypto.". </p> <p>  To do this, I'm using the following piece of C# code:  <span style="font-family: monospace; color: #333;">   <code>    Regex packEx = new Regex(@"(java.security.\w*|javax.crypto.\w*)");   </code>  </span>  The use of grouping in this regular expression is essential for finding these specific patterns within the data.                        By using the parentheses, we are able to group together the "java.security." and "javax.crypto." patterns, and the use of the pipe symbol (|) allows us to search for either of these patterns.                         The \w* characters at the end of each group allow for any combination of alphanumeric characters to follow these patterns. </p> <p>  In addition to searching for Java packages, I have also been using regular expressions to find instances of Android permission usage in the files.                         To do this, I am using the following regular expression:  <span style="font-family: monospace; color: #333;">   <code>    @"([\w])([^(]{[^{](android.permission.[A-Z_])"   </code>  </span> </p> <p>  This regular expression searches for any instance of "android.permission." followed by one or more capitalized and underscore-separated characters.                         The use of the square brackets, parentheses, and curly braces allows for the search to be specific to the use of Android permissions within the code and to capture the method and class names that the permission usage is found in. </p> <p>  Compiling the regular expression before using it in loops is also an important consideration for efficiency.                         When a regular expression is compiled, it is converted into an optimized form that is faster to execute.                         This is especially important when running the regex function on a large number of files within a loop. </p> <p>  As an undergraduate, I had the opportunity to learn C# with Dr. Dowell, and I have continued to enjoy using this language in my research and professional endeavors.                         In my recent work on the Vault project, I found C#'s regular expression language and the ability to walk through file trees recursively to be particularly useful tools. </p> <p>  While using C# on a Mac has presented some challenges, such as the lack of a fully-featured visual studio edition, I have found that the benefits of using this language far outweigh any difficulties.                         I am grateful for the opportunity to have learned C# during my undergraduate studies, and I continue to enjoy using it in my work. </p> <!-- Desc: Learn how to use C# regular expression language for searching and finding specific patterns within data, including Android permission usage and Java encryption and security package imports.

	<description><div class="blog"> <h4>  December 27th, 2022 </h4> <div class="title">  Progress Report on PhD Research Project: Detecting Vault Apps using Machine Learning </div> <img alt="Aptoide Logo" height="445" src="photos/aptoide.webp" width="250"/> <p>  Hi everyone, </p> <p>  I wanted to give an update on the progress of my PhD research project, which focuses on using                        machine learning to detect vault apps in the Aptoide 3rd party Android app store.                        As some of you may know, I've been working on this project since last March and it will be a                        part of my dissertation. </p> <p>  So far, we have scraped 500 apps from the app store and collected all the text and images from                        the individual sites.                        We have also downloaded any freely available apk files associated with the apps and decompiled                        them into java files.                        Using regular expressions, we are searching for any permissions data or imported packages in the                        files that may suggest that a particular app is a vault app. </p> <p>  The data we gather through this process will be used to train a machine learning program to                        detect these types of apps.                        The vault apps will serve as positive examples, while the non-vault apps will be negative                        examples. </p> <p>  Our goal is to use this research to create a piece of software that can help law enforcement                        locate hidden vault apps on the devices of bad actors, such as foreign agents or drug dealers,                        and determine how the information is stored (e.g. locally on the device, in an accessible cloud                        storage service, or securely encrypted locally on the device). </p> <p>  Overall, the project is progressing well and I'm excited to see the results of our machine                        learning program once it is trained on the data we've collected.                        I'll be sure to keep you updated on any further developments. </p> <p>  Thanks for reading! </p> <!-- Desc: Get an update on my PhD research project using machine learning to detect vault apps in the Aptoide 3rd party Android app store.
