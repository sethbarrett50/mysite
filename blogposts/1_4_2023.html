                    <p>
                        If you run a blog or website, it's important to keep your readers informed of new content by providing an RSS feed. But manually updating the feed can be a tedious process. 
                        In this post, I'll show you how to automate the process using a combination of shell and Python scripts.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Setting up the RSS Feed</h5>
                    <p>
                        First, I create the RSS feed itself. 
                        I based my feed on the formatting described in this tutorial: <a href="https://rss.com/blog/how-to-create-an-rss-feed/">How to Create an RSS Feed.</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I then created an <code>rss.xml</code> file in my blogposts directory and formatted it according to the tutorial. 
                        Then, I got to work on automating the input of blog post details.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Automating the Process</h5>
                    <p>
                        I started by writing a shell script that calls a Python script and passes the first argument (the name of an HTML file for a blog post) to the script:
                    </p>
<p><pre>#!/bin/bash
python3 /Users/SEBARRETT/Code/updateRss.py "$1"</pre></p>
                    <p>
                        Next, I wrote a Python script that does the following:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Takes the name of an HTML file for a blog post as an argument</li>
                        <li>Uses Beautiful Soup to parse the HTML file and extract the <code>div</code> element with the class "blog"</li>
                        <li>Returns the title and contents of the blog post</li>
                        <li>Inserts the title and contents into the <code>rss.xml</code> file as a new <code>item</code> element, below the <code>atom</code> element and above all the other <code>item</code> elements</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The complete Python script can be found <a href="https://github.com/sethbarrett50/update_RSS_Feed">here:</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To parse the HTML document, the script uses Beautiful Soup to extract the <code>div</code> element with the class "blog" and its contents.
                        I had experience using BS4 from my previous work on my Vault research project, so this was a breeze.
                        The extracted title and contents are then inserted into the <code>rss.xml</code> file as a new <code>item</code> element, below the <code>atom</code> element and above all the other <code>item</code> elements. 
                        The <code>item</code> element includes the title of the post, a link to the post, the publication date using the <code>datetime</code> library, and the main contents of the post. 
                        After testing the script, it was successfully able to update the <code>rss.xml</code> file with the new blog post information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To make the shell script executable, the command <code>chmod +x updateRSS.sh</code> was used. 
                        An alias for the script was also added to the <code>zsh</code> configuration file.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the future, I plan to have the script automatically detect when a new blog post has been added using <code>git add</code> and <code>grep</code>, and then run the script automatically to update the RSS feed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you'd like to follow our RSS feed, the URL is <code>sethbarrett.xyz/blogposts/rss.xml</code>.
                    </p>
                    <!-- Desc: This blog post discusses how to automate the process of updating an RSS feed for a blog or website using shell and Python scripts. The post describes how the RSS feed was set up and the process of creating a shell script that calls a Python script to extract the title and contents of a new blog post and insert it into the RSS feed as a new item element. The post also mentions plans to have the script automatically detect when a new blog post has been added and run the update automatically in the future.
