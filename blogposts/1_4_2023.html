                    <p>
                        If you run a blog or website, it's important to keep your readers informed of new content by providing an RSS feed. But manually updating the feed can be a tedious process. 
                        In this post, I'll show you how to automate the process using a combination of shell and Python scripts.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Setting up the RSS Feed</h5>
                    <p>
                        First, I create the RSS feed itself. 
                        I based my feed on the formatting described in this tutorial: <a href="https://rss.com/blog/how-to-create-an-rss-feed/">How to Create an RSS Feed.</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I then created an `rss.xml` file in my blogposts directory and formatted it according to the tutorial. 
                        Then, I got to work on automating the input of blog post details.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Automating the Process</h5>
                    <p>
                        I started by writing a shell script that calls a Python script and passes the first argument (the name of an HTML file for a blog post) to the script:
                    </p>
                    <p><pre>
                        #!/bin/bash

                        python3 /Users/SEBARRETT/Code/updateRss.py "$1"
                    </pre></p>
                    <p>
                        Next, I wrote a Python script that does the following:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Takes the name of an HTML file for a blog post as an argument</li>
                        <li>Uses Beautiful Soup to parse the HTML file and extract the `div` element with the class "blog"</li>
                        <li>Returns the title and contents of the blog post</li>
                        <li>Inserts the title and contents into the `rss.xml` file as a new `item` element, below the `atom` element and above all the other `item` elements</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The complete Python script can be found <a href="https://github.com/sethbarrett50/update_RSS_Feed">here:</a>
                    </p>
                    <!-- <p><pre>

                        def getBlogContents() -> tuple[str]:
                            with open(f'/Users/SEBARRETT/Code/mysite/blogposts/{sys.argv[1]}', 'r') as f:

                        blogContents = getBlogContents()

                        main()
                    </pre></p> -->
                    <p>
                        To parse the HTML document, the script uses Beautiful Soup to extract the `div` element with the class "blog" and its contents.
                        I had experience using BS4 from my previous work on my Vault research project, so this was a breeze.
                        The extracted title and contents are then inserted into the `rss.xml` file as a new `item` element, below the `atom` element and above all the other `item` elements. 
                        The `item` element includes the title of the post, a link to the post, the publication date using the `datetime` library, and the main contents of the post. 
                        After testing the script, it was successfully able to update the `rss.xml` file with the new blog post information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To make the shell script executable, the command `chmod +x updateRSS.sh` was used. 
                        An alias for the script was also added to the `zsh` configuration file.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the future, I plan to have the script automatically detect when a new blog post has been added using `git add` and `grep`, and then run the script automatically to update the RSS feed.
                    </p>
