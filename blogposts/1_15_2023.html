                    <p>
                        Hello and welcome back to my intro to Python series! 
                        In the previous posts, we learned about advanced concepts such as exception handling, object-oriented programming, inheritance, polymorphism, and web scraping with <code>requests</code> and <code>Beautiful Soup</code>. 
                        In this post, we're going to look at a library for browser automation: <code>Selenium</code>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <code>Selenium</code> is a library for automating web browser actions. 
                        It allows you to programmatically control a web browser (such as Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) and perform actions such as navigating to websites, filling out forms, clicking buttons, and extracting data. 
                        This can be useful for tasks such as web scraping, testing, and automating repetitive actions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To use <code>Selenium</code>, you need to install the library and also install a web driver for the browser you want to use. 
                        For example, to use Chrome, you need to install the <code>chromedriver</code> executable. 
                        Then, you can use the <code>webdriver</code> module to control the browser:
                    </p>
<p><pre>from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriverQ.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC


driver = webdriver.Chrome()  # start Chrome
driver.get("http://www.example.com")  # navigate to a website
sub_btn = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
    EC.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, "submit_button"))
)
sub_btn.click()
driver.close()  # close the browser
</pre></p>
                    <p>
                        Selenium provides a rich API for interacting with web elements such as buttons, links, and forms.
                        ou can use methods such as EC.presence_of_element_located() inside a <code>WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(...)</code> code block to wait for an element to load, then locate the element on the webpage and perform actions on them. 
                        Elements can be located with their <code>ID</code>, <code>CLASS_NAME</code>, <code>CSS_SELECTOR</code>, <code>LINK_TEXT</code>, <code>NAME</code>, <code>PARTIAL_LINK_NAME</code>, <code>TAG_NAME</code> or <code>XPATH</code>.
                        For example:
                    </p>
<p><pre>from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriverQ.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC

driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.get("http://www.example.com")

# Fill out a form
name_box = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
    EC.presence_of_element_located((By.XPATH,"//*[@id='name']"))
)
name_box.send_keys("John Smith")
email_box = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
    EC.presence_of_element_located((By.XPATH,"//*[@id='email']"))
)
email_box.send_keys("jon@example.com")
sub_btn = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
    EC.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, "submit_button"))
)
sub_btn.click()

# Extract data from the webpage
name  = driver.find_element(By.ID, "name").get_attribute("value")
print(name)  # prints "John Smith"

driver.close() </pre></p>
                    <p>
                        <code>Selenium</code> is a powerful library for automating web browser actions, and it can be a useful tool for tasks such as web scraping, testing, and automation. 
                        However, it can be slower than other libraries because it runs in a real web browser and loads all the web page resources.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I hope this post has introduced you to the <code>Selenium</code> library for browser automation in Python. 
                        In the next post, we'll look at some more advanced topics in Python. Thanks for reading!
                    </p>
