                    <p>
                        Welcome back to our Advanced Machine Learning series! In this blog post, we'll dive into the captivating domain of Time Series Forecasting, where AI systems aim to predict future values based on historical time series data.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Understanding Time Series Data</h5>
                    <p>
                        Time Series data consists of observations recorded over time at regular intervals. Examples include stock prices, temperature measurements, and sales data. Time Series Forecasting leverages temporal patterns in the data to make predictions about future values.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Key Techniques in Time Series Forecasting</h5>
                    <p><ol>
                        <li><b>Autoregressive Models:</b>
                            Autoregressive models, such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), predict future values based on the previous observations in the time series. These models capture trends, seasonality, and cyclic patterns in the data.</li>
                        <li><b>Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks:</b>
                            LSTM networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for time series forecasting. LSTMs can learn long-term dependencies in the data and handle variable-length sequences.</li>
                        <li><b>Seasonal Decomposition:</b>
                            Seasonal decomposition techniques separate a time series into its seasonal, trend, and residual components, aiding in identifying underlying patterns.</li>
                        <li><b>Prophet:</b>
                            Prophet is a forecasting tool developed by Facebook that combines time series decomposition with additive models. It is particularly useful for capturing seasonal patterns and holidays in the data.</li>
                    </ol></p>
                    <h5>Applications of Time Series Forecasting</h5>
                    <p>
                        Time Series Forecasting finds applications in various domains, including:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Finance: </b>
                                Forecasting stock prices, exchange rates, and financial market trends</li>
                            <li><b>Sales Forecasting: </b>
                                Predicting future sales trends for businesses to plan inventory and marketing strategies.</li>
                            <li><b>Weather Forecasting: </b>
                                Providing accurate weather predictions based on historical weather data.</li>
                            <li><b>Anomaly Detection: </b>
                                Identifying unusual patterns and deviations in time series data for anomaly detection.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h5>Implementing Time Series Forecasting with Julia and Flux.jl</h5>
                    <p>Let's explore how to implement Time Series Forecasting using autoregressive models with Julia and Flux.jl.</p>
<p><pre># Load required packages
using Flux
using ARIMA

# Load time series data
time_series_data = load_time_series_data()

# Fit ARIMA model to the time series data
model = ARIMA.fit(time_series_data, order=(p, d, q))

# Forecast future values using the ARIMA model
future_forecast = ARIMA.forecast(model, n_forecast)</pre></p>
                    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                    <p>
                        Time Series Forecasting equips AI systems with the ability to predict future values based on historical temporal patterns. In this blog post, we've explored autoregressive models, LSTM networks, seasonal decomposition, and the applications of Time Series Forecasting in finance, sales forecasting, weather forecasting, and anomaly detection.
                    </p>
