                <h4>Undergraduate and Graduate Student Government</h4>
                <div class='dates'>January 2022 - May 2022</div>
                <div class='title'>GSGA-SGA Liaison</div>
                <div class='description'>During my tenure as the GSGA-SGA liaison at Augusta University, I attended
                    meetings for both the graduate and undergraduate student governments and worked to ensure that
                    relevant information was shared between the two organizations. As the first person to hold this
                    position, I had the unique opportunity of assisting in several initiatives to bring the two student
                    governments together to benefit both undergraduate and graduate students. Through this experience, I
                    gained valuable insight into the workings of student government and the challenges and opportunities
                    that come with representing the interests of multiple groups of students. I also learned the
                    importance of effective communication and collaboration in achieving shared goals. Overall, my time
                    as a GSGA-SGA liaison was a valuable and rewarding experience that helped me develop my leadership
                    and communication skills.</div>

                <div class='description'>As a member of Delta Chi at Augusta University, I have had the opportunity to
                    develop strong character and lifelong friendships with my fellow students. In addition, the
                    fraternity has provided me with a supportive community that has helped me in my pursuit of a sound
                    education. During my time in Delta Chi, I held the positions of Philanthropy and Scholastics Chair,
                    where I was responsible for organizing and implementing a range of activities and initiatives to
                    benefit the fraternity and its members. As Philanthropy Chair, I helped raise over $5,400 for the
                    Jimmy V Foundation for cancer research, which was a rewarding and meaningful experience. As
                    Scholastics Chair, I worked to support the academic success of my fellow brothers by providing them
                    with access to excellent study resources and tutoring at Augusta University's Academic Success
                    Center. Through my involvement in Delta Chi and my work as Philanthropy and Scholastics Chair, I
                    have gained valuable leadership and organizational skills and made a positive impact on my
                    community.</div>

                <div class='description'>As a member of JagByte, a living learning community for Computer Science and

                    security at AU. The events and activities allowed me to learn more about the latest developments in
                    cyber security and to connect with experts in the field. Through my participation in the JagByte
                    program, I gained valuable knowledge, skills, and experience that can help me succeed in my studies

                <div class='title'>Eagle Scout</div>
                <div class='description'>As a member of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA), I have had the opportunity to

                    leadership skills and learn important lessons for life. Through my involvement in the BSA program, I
                    have had the chance to attend camps, participate in service projects, and take part in outdoor
                    adventures. I have also had the opportunity to work on earning merit badges and other awards,
                    including the rank of Eagle Scout. Obtaining the rank of Eagle Scout has been a challenging and
                    rewarding experience that has taught me the importance of perseverance, determination, and hard
                    work. The BSA program has provided me with a strong foundation of skills and values that I will
