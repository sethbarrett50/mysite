                <div class='description'>During my tenure as the GSGA-SGA liaison at Augusta University, I attended
                    meetings for both the graduate and undergraduate student governments and worked to ensure that
                    relevant information was shared between the two organizations. As the first person to hold this
                    position, I had the unique opportunity of assisting in several initiatives to bring the two student
                    governments together to benefit both undergraduate and graduate students. Through this experience, I
                    gained valuable insight into the workings of student government and the challenges and opportunities
                    that come with representing the interests of multiple groups of students. I also learned the
                    importance of effective communication and collaboration in achieving shared goals. Overall, my time
                    as a GSGA-SGA liaison was a valuable and rewarding experience that helped me develop my leadership
